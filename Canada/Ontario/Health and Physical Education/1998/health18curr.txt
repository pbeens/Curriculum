Introduction
The Purpose of The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8: Health and Physical Education, 1998 Healthy active living involves a combination of physical activity and appropriate lifestyle choices. Students should begin early on to acquire basic knowledge about a wide variety of health-related topics and to develop relevant skills. They need to understand how their actions and decisions affect their health, fitness, and personal well-being, and how to apply their learning to make positive, healthy decisions in all areas of life and personal development. The school environment can profoundly influence students’ attitudes, preferences, and behaviours.

Through the health and physical education curriculum, students will develop:
• an understanding of the importance of physical fitness, health, and well-being and the factors that contribute to them;
• a personal commitment to daily vigorous physical activity and positive health behaviours;
• the basic movement skills they require to participate in physical activities throughout their lives.

The achievement of the objectives of the health and physical education program will not only enhance each student’s life but will also result in a healthier population. Students’ knowledge of the importance of daily vigorous physical activity will also help them understand how such activity combats health risks such as obesity and heart disease.

A comprehensive approach to health and physical education emphasizes the shared responsibility of parents, peers, schools, health-care systems, government, the media, and a variety of other institutions and agencies. Meaningful health and physical education also requires safe, health-promoting environments, support services from the community, and a school curriculum
that makes health a priority in the school. 

This document replaces the sections of The Common Curriculum: Policies and Outcomes, Grades 1-9, 1995 that relate to health and physical education. All health and physical education programs for Grades 1 to 8 will be based on the expectations outlined in this document.

The Role of Parents
Studies show that students perform better in school if their parents are involved in their education. Parents therefore have an important role to play in supporting their children’s learning. By reading the curriculum, parents can find out what their children are learning in each grade and why they are learning it. This knowledge of the curriculum will enable parents to discuss their children’s work with them, to communicate with teachers, and to ask relevant questions about their children’s progress. Their knowledge of the expectations in each grade will also help parents interpret their children’s report cards and work with teachers to improve students’ learning. For this reason, parents are urged to read the expectations for all grades rather than just the particular grades their children are in.
 
Parents can also participate in parent conferences,work on school councils, and become involved in physical activities with their children. They should support classroom activities, promote and participate both in special events held within the school and in interschool activities, and promote healthy active living through their own habits and practices. They should
also support healthy eating and take responsibility for developing their children’s self-esteem.

The Role of Teachers
Teachers and students have complementary responsibilities.Teachers are responsible for developing a variety of appropriate instructional strategies that will involve students actively in the curriculum and at the same time address different student needs. They should bring enthusiasm to the classroom and should model healthy active living in their own lives to encourage
students to recognize the value and relevance of what they are learning.

The Role of Students
Students have responsibilities with regard to their own learning, which increase as they advance through elementary and secondary school. Those willing to make the effort required and able to apply themselves soon learn that there is a direct relationship between achievement and hard work. Such students become motivated, self-directed learners.

Some students, however, find it more difficult to take responsibility for their learning because of special challenges they face. For these students, the attention, patience, and encouragement of teachers can be extremely important factors for success. Regardless of their circumstances, learning to take responsibility for their own progress and learning is an important part of education for all students.

Strands in the Health and Physical Education Curriculum
The curriculum’s major areas of knowledge and skills are organized around three strands:
• Healthy living includes healthy eating, growth and development, personal safety and injury prevention, and substance use and abuse.
• Fundamental movement skills include locomotion/travelling, manipulation, and stability.
• Active participation includes physical activity, physical fitness, living skills, and safety.

These strands combine the living skills (e.g., personal, interpersonal, communication, conflictresolution, goal-setting, organizational, time-management, problem-solving, and decisionmaking skills) that all students require.

The Importance of Safety
Schools must develop procedures to ensure the highest possible level of safety, while allowing students to engage in a broad range of challenging activities. Safety guidelines should outline the practices to be followed for each activity, addressing questions related to equipment, clothing, facilities, special rules and instructions, and supervision. They should also reflect school board policies on how to conduct activities, and they should be reviewed on a regular basis. While all physical activity involves an element of risk, participants have an obligation to minimize that risk.

Concern for safety should be an integral part of curriculum planning and implementation. The primary responsibility for ensuring safe practices rests with the school district and its employees. Wherever possible, potential risks must be identified and procedures developed to prevent or minimize accidents or injuries. In a safe classroom, the teacher will be aware of up-to-date safety information, will observe students carefully, show foresight, and act quickly. By implementing safe instructional practices (e.g., logical teaching progressions and ageappropriate activities), educators can reduce risks and guard against accidents.

In a safe school, students will:
• follow established routines for physical activities (e.g., set procedures for entering and leaving the gym and changing clothes,warm-up and cool-down activities);
• wear clothing appropriate to activities (e.g., a hat for outdoor activities),wear appropriate footwear and ensure that shoelaces are tied, and remove jewellery when participating in physical activities;
• follow the instructions outlined for each activity (e.g., for starting and stopping);
• take age-appropriate responsibility (e.g., for the safe use of equipment) and necessary precautions (e.g., use a safety mat);
• follow rules and expectations pertaining to the setting for the activity (e.g., ski only in designated areas, follow playground rules);
• recognize and report unsafe situations and conditions;
• always play safely.

Attitudes in Health and Physical Education
Students’ attitudes towards health and physical education can have a significant effect on their achievement of the expectations.To learn effectively and develop positive attitudes towards healthy active living, students should enjoy the skill-development and physical activities. They should also come to recognize the importance of observing safety procedures, respecting others, and being punctual. (These attitudes are incorporated into the specific expectations.)

The Use of Computers in the Health and Physical Education Curriculum
This curriculum provides students with opportunities to use software programs, the Internet, e-mail, and audio and visual technology for a variety of purposes. For example, students can use technology to record food choices over a period of time, measure nutrient intake, maintain a fitness profile, evaluate an individual’s physical stages, monitor physical performance, and develop personal exercise programs. They can use the World Wide Web to access and research information on various health-and-fitness topics and issues. 

Planning Student Programs
Teachers must provide a balanced program with a broad selection of activities. In doing so, they can combine expectations from more than one of the three strands to help students see the connections between physical skills and health concepts (e.g., that daily physical activity improves health and physical fitness).

Teachers must also ensure that the concepts and skills taught are appropriate to students’ ages and stages of development, and to their perceptions, prior knowledge, attitudes, learning styles, and exceptionalities. They must use a variety of instructional approaches to ensure that all students are given every opportunity to learn and perform to their full potential.

This curriculum requires that students participate in sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity for a minimum of twenty minutes each day. This requirement can be met in a variety of ways, using school and community indoor and outdoor facilities.

Co-curricular programs. Where possible, the health and physical education curriculum will include both curricular and complementary cocurricular components. Intramural programs allow all students to participate in either same-sex or coeducational activities that are informal and not highly competitive. Interschool programs offer students opportunities to participate in more organized and competitive activities. Other recreational activities and clubs also provide opportunities for students with common interests and a desire to participate in physical activities in non-competitive settings. In planning and organizing the health and physical education curriculum, schools should use community organizations, facilities, and programs as resources to provide students with additional experiences and opportunities for physical activities.

Coeducational and segregated classes. Although all the curriculum expectations can be achieved in either coeducational or same-sex classes, some expectations can be addressed more effectively in same-sex settings. For example, discussions involving topics of a sensitive nature, especially those in the Healthy Living strand, can be uncomfortable for some students, but these same students might feel quite secure and comfortable discussing these topics in a samesex setting. Similarly, when expectations related to skill development (particularly team-sport skills) are addressed, same-sex classes and groupings might encourage more students to become physically active and to participate in the interschool program, as well as in community activities.Teachers should base their decisions as to whether to teach in coeducational or segregated settings on the sensitivity of topics and students’ needs.

Planning for the coeducational classroom. Acknowledgement of and respect for individual differences will encourage student participation and help students learn to collaborate with and respect others. They will also enhance students’ competence, self-esteem, health, and wellbeing. The health and physical education program will address students’ awareness of and
esteem for each other. Strategies for encouraging this awareness and mutual respect among students include:

• providing opportunities for both male and female students to assume leadership roles;
• encouraging and respecting the interests and abilities of both genders;
• ensuring that responsibilities are shared equally by male and female students;
• expecting all students to be equally active participants;
• creating a class atmosphere that helps students develop consideration for, understanding of, and respect for each other.

Cross-curricular planning. Health and physical education are essential to the entire school curriculum. Studies show that students who participate in physical activity each day exhibit improved memory, concentration, and communication, problem-solving, and leadership abilities, which improve their learning in other subject areas. Such students also display more positive attitudes towards themselves, improved interpersonal behaviour, and a willingness to meet and deal with the challenges of daily life. Because active learning is so important for all students, the provincial curriculum requires a minimum of twenty minutes of sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity each day.

The development of skills and knowledge in the areas of health and physical education is related to learning in other subjects. When planning programs, teachers should emphasize such cross-curricular relationships by co-ordinating the teaching of related expectations. For example, in Grade 5, students could describe the short- and long-term effects of alcohol (health and physical education), learn about its properties (science and technology), and represent in a graph the results of a survey of a select group of people with regard to its use and abuse (mathematics). At the conclusion of the unit, students could be asked to report orally or in writing (language arts) on the impact of alcohol on people’s lives.

Health and Physical Education for Exceptional Students
Recognizing the needs of exceptional students and providing appropriate programs and services for them are important aspects of planning and implementing the curriculum. Specific procedures are set out in legislation for the identification and placement of exceptional students. The needs of exceptional students are identified by an Identification, Placement, and
Review Committee (IPRC).

When an IPRC identifies a student as exceptional, an Individual Education Plan (IEP) must be developed and maintained for that student. (It should be noted that an IEP may also be prepared for students with special needs who are receiving special education programs and/or services but who have not been identified as exceptional by an IPRC). An IEP defines the
student’s educational program as one that is based on and modified by the results of continuous assessment and evaluation. It identifies the student’s specific learning expectations and explains how the school will address these expectations (for example, through appropriate programs and services, modifications in the regular program, and other accommodations). It also identifies the methods by which the student’s progress will be reviewed.

In developing the student’s IEP, consideration must be given to any recommendations made by the IPRC concerning programs and services that may be particularly appropriate for meeting the student’s needs. Also, the school must consult with the parents of the student at the development stage. The IPRC’s recommendations and the results of consultation between the parents and the school staff will form the basis of decisions concerning the ways in which the learning expectations set out in the provincial curriculum will be modified to meet the student’s special needs. Once the IEP has been developed, the parents of the student must be provided with a copy.

Those involved in developing the IEP should work together on an ongoing basis to review the student’s progress and make adjustments to the IEP as necessary. It is important that the school continue to keep parents informed about the program and the progress of the student, as parents can provide valuable support for their child’s learning.

In health and physical education, exceptional students may need a variety of modifications
both to the program itself and to the learning environment. These modifications may include:

• facilities that allow for the mobility of students with physical disabilities;
• equipment modifications that enable all students to perform to their full potential (e.g., increasing the length of a scoop handle to enable a student who uses a wheelchair to reach the floor);
• program modifications (e.g., altering the method of instruction);
• assessment and evaluation strategies that accommodate a variety of learning styles and needs;
• encouraging as much student participation as possible in planning, instruction, assessment, and evaluation;
• using support systems extensively.

The Use of Equipment and Facilities
Since equipment and facilities in individual schools will vary across the province, care has been taken in this curriculum to ensure that students can meet the expectations in a variety of settings and with a broad range of equipment. The curriculum stresses daily active participation in physical activities that do not necessarily require the use of a school ymnasium.Teachers are encouraged to use various school and community facilities for their programs – schoolyards, soccer fields, baseball diamonds, football fields, swimming pools, arenas – and to help students develop specific skills through a variety of activities. Exposure to these various settings will increase students’ awareness of community facilities.

Teachers can use equipment to focus on students’ specific skill development and to vary physical activities. When supplies are limited, teachers will have to be resourceful to ensure that each student has opportunities to use various types of equipment. For example, an activity that focuses on catching objects of various sizes and shapes could include the use of bean bags, tennis balls, beach balls, and Frisbees.

Teachers must provide specific instruction to students on the appropriate handling of equipment, ensure that equipment is in good repair and suitably organized, and take into account the height,weight, and ages of the students using the equipment.

Curriculum Expectations and Achievement Levels

The chart that follows identifies four categories of skills in health and physical education:
understanding of concepts, movement skills, active participation, and communication of required knowledge. For each of these categories, there are four levels of achievement. These  levels are brief descriptions of degrees of achievement that teachers will use as the basis for their assessment of each student’s work.

Teachers should use the descriptions to identify the level at which a student has achieved a particular expectation, or a group of expectations, in the appropriate category of knowledge or skills. For example, if the student communicates most of the concepts taught, requires no encouragement to participate, and usually performs the skills as described, the student’s
achievement would be at level 3. The characteristics given for level 3 represent achievement that is considered to be the standard for the grade.

Although the main purpose of the chart is for assessing student achievement, teachers may also use it for other related purposes. For example, they could use it as a guide when observing students’ performance or to explain the different levels of achievement to parents.

Healthy Living

The healthy living strand will provide students with the knowledge and skills they need to develop, maintain, and enjoy healthy lifestyles, as well as to solve problems, make decisions, and set goals that are directly related to personal health and well-being. The four components of this strand are healthy eating, growth and development, personal safety and injury prevention, and substance use and abuse.
 
Healthy eating.Topics related to healthy eating include nutrition, eating disorders, body image, and dental health. Students require knowledge to make healthy eating choices. Using this knowledge, they will examine their own food choices and eating patterns, and then make wise decisions and set appropriate goals. In later grades, students will learn more about the
factors that affect healthy body weight and lead to eating disorders, and will increase their understanding of a healthy body image. Throughout the healthy living strand, the importance of healthy eating and regular physical activity is emphasized.

Growth and development. Growth and development education is more than simply teaching young people about the anatomy and physiology of reproduction. For example, growth and development education focuses on an understanding of sexuality in its broadest context – sexual development, reproductive health, interpersonal relationships, affection, abstinence, body image, and gender roles. Acquiring information and skills and developing attitudes, beliefs, and values related to identity and relationships are lifelong processes.

Parents and guardians are the primary educators of their children. As children grow and develop relationships with family members and others, they learn about appropriate behaviours and values, as well as about sexuality. They are influenced by parents, friends, relatives, religious leaders, teachers, and neighbours, as well as by television, radio, videos, movies, books, advertisements,music, and newspapers. School-based programs add another important dimension to a child’s ongoing learning about sexuality.

The overall and specific expectations in this strand are age-appropriate and should be addressed with sensitivity and respect for individual differences. Because of the sensitive nature of these topics, parents or guardians must be informed about the content of the curriculum and time of delivery.Teachers and learners must develop a comfort level with these topics so that information can be discussed openly, honestly, and in an atmosphere of mutual respect. The “healthy sexuality” expectations should be addressed only after teachers have developed rapport with their students. Opportunities should be provided for segregated as well as coeducational instruction.

Personal safety and injury prevention. Personal safety and injury prevention are essential components of the healthy living strand. Education in these areas is critical for reducing children’s injuries. Personal safety topics include bullying, peer assault, child abuse, harassment, and violence in relationships. Injury prevention topics include bicycle safety, seasonal safety rules, sun protection, home safety, fire safety, seat belt use, and first aid. The expectations address the knowledge and skills needed to reduce safety risks at home, at school, and in the community.

Students will become familiar with the support available to them within the family as well as with the agencies and services that provide support and help within the community. However, knowledge alone is not enough; students require the necessary skills to respond appropriately to situations that threaten their personal safety and well-being. Living skills such as conflict resolution, assertiveness, resistance and refusal techniques, and decision making will help them respond to situations effectively.

Substance use and abuse. Education is critical to the prevention of drug abuse. Parents, guardians, educators, and society in general all have key roles to play in educating students about drug use and abuse.

Alcohol and tobacco are the drugs most readily available to Ontario students, and smoking is the primary cause of preventable illnesses, disabilities, and premature deaths in Canada. The substance use and abuse learning expectations respond to these facts by focusing on an understanding of the effects of drugs – prescription drugs, non-prescription drugs, illicit drugs,
tobacco, alcohol – and the consequences of their use. This knowledge is integrated with the development of a variety of living skills that help students make and maintain healthy choices. 

By using problem-solving, decision-making, refusal, and assertiveness skills effectively, learners can select healthy, drug-free behaviours based on accurate information.

Fundamental Movement Skills

The movement skills are organized into three categories:
– locomotion/travelling, in which the body moves from one point to another (e.g.,walking, running, skipping, hopping, galloping, chasing, fleeing, dodging)
– manipulation, which involves giving force to objects or receiving force from objects (e.g., throwing, catching, collecting, kicking, punting, dribbling, volleying, striking)
– stability, in which the body remains in place but moves around its horizontal or vertical axis (e.g., bending, stretching, twisting, turning, rolling, balancing, transferring weight, curling up, landing from a jump)

These basic movement skills are the foundation of all physical activity and are essential both to an individual’s development of effective motor skills and to the application of these skills in a wide variety of physical activities. Since the skills can also enhance students’ interpersonal, cognitive, and emotional development, it is critical that the health and physical education program be inclusive, engaging all students irrespective of their gender, background, or ability.

When fun and enjoyment are part of skill development and physical activity, students are more likely to develop positive attitudes towards healthy active living.

Students will develop skills related to the following four principles of movement:
– body awareness (what parts the body moves)
– space awareness (where the body moves, e.g., location, direction, or level)
– effort (how the body moves, e.g., fast or slow, with strong or light force, or bound or free)
– relationship (with whom or with what the body moves, e.g., with people or with objects)

Movement principles and skills must be taught in association with other activities. They must also be taught in the proper progression and through age-appropriate activities.

Research into motor development indicates that learners acquire new fundamental movement skills (motor skills) most successfully during the preschool and elementary years as students’ neurological pathways are developing rapidly during this period and are receptive to the development of fundamental movement patterns and basic skills. When young children enter
school, their movements are often awkward and lacking in fluidity. In the early school years, they gain necessary co-ordination and control over their movements. They can then refine, extend, and apply these patterns to more complex skills during later childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. For example, the basic skill of throwing an object overhand can be transferred to a tennis serve or badminton smash.

Movement skills must be taught; they are not acquired simply through activities of various sorts. As well, mature movement skills do not result from physical maturation alone; rather, they must be continually refined and combined with other movement skills in a variety of physical activities.

Safety must be an integral part of the health and physical education program. While teachers have the ultimate responsibility for matters related to supervision, equipment, facilities, and procedures, students must take some responsibility for their own safety, beginning at a very young age. Following procedures, using equipment as instructed, and wearing appropriate
attire are some ways in which students can contribute to their safe participation in physical activity. Safety is addressed in the overall expectations for each grade and is implicit in all of the specific expectations. Students must fulfil each expectation safely and responsibly without putting themselves and others at risk.

Active Participation

Daily vigorous physical activity must become part of each child’s routine and way of life. The health and physical education program, which includes vigorous physical activity for all learners throughout the school year, will help children to become fit, independent learners; to develop interpersonal skills by interacting with others; and to relate fitness activities to healthy, productive lives. The four components of this strand are physical activity, physical fitness, living skills, and safety.

Students are expected to participate vigorously on a regular basis in a wide range of physical activities. Also, students are required to participate in sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity for a minimum of twenty minutes each day in order to improve or maintain their physical fitness.*[This requirement is effective as of October 6, 2005.] This requirement is reflected in a curriculum expectation included in every grade in this strand.

Physical activity. Participation in physical activity provides students with a variety of opportunities for increasing their self-esteem and developing positive interpersonal skills and attitudes, including practices of fair play and respect for others. Students, individually and in groups, should be strongly encouraged to participate daily in a wide variety of physical activities 
– dance, gymnastics, aquatics, and fitness and recreational activities (where facilities permit)
– and to become increasingly responsible for their own daily physical activity.

Especially where facilities are limited and must be shared by large numbers of students, the scheduling of regular physical education classes will require some creativity (e.g., twentyminute as opposed to thirty-minute gym periods, the use of portables) and the use of alternative venues, such as parks, fields, and nearby community facilities.

Physical fitness.Teachers must use a variety of methods to encourage students to develop such aspects of physical fitness as flexibility, agility, co-ordination, strength, balance, and, especially, cardiovascular respiratory endurance. As levels of fitness improve, the duration of vigorous activity must be regularly increased. Students will become involved in assessing their own fitness levels, setting personal goals, and developing plans to achieve them.

Living skills. The development of living skills (e.g., decision-making, goal-setting, communication, time-management, organizational, problem-solving, conflict-resolution, and interpersonal skills) is an integral part of all aspects of the physical and health education curriculum, but particularly of this strand. The program will help students to combine these living skills with physical activity and fitness skills, and to apply these skills in ways that will be useful throughout their lives. 

Safety. Safety must be an integral part of the program. While teachers have responsibility for matters related to supervision, equipment, facilities, and procedures, students must take some responsibility for their own safety at a very young age. Following procedures, using equipment as instructed, and wearing appropriate attire are some ways in which students can contribute to their safe participation in physical activity. Safety is addressed in the overall expectations and is implicit in all of the specific expectations for each grade. Students must fulfil each expectation safely and responsibly without putting themselves and others at risk.

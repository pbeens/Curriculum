INTRODUCTION

This document replaces all but the Computer and Information Science component of The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 11 and 12: Technological Education, 2000. Beginning in September 2009, all technological education courses for Grades 11 and 12 will be based on the expectations outlined in this document. 

SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 
The goal of Ontario secondary schools is to support high-quality learning while giving individual students the opportunity to choose programs that suit their skills and interests. The updated Ontario curriculum, in combination with a broader range of learning options outside traditional classroom instruction, will enable students to better customize their high school education and improve their prospects for success in school and in life. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION IN THE CURRICULUM 

Technological innovation influences all areas of life, from the daily lives of individuals to the work of business and government, to interactions on a global scale. It helps meet basic human needs and provides tools for improving people's lives and exploring new frontiers. The policy outlined in this document is designed to ensure that technological education in Ontario enables students to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century. 

The power, reach, and rapid evolution of technology demand a curriculum that will enable students to become technologically literate � that is, able to understand, work with, and benefit from a range of technologies. Students need to acquire the technological skills and knowledge that will allow them to participate fully in a competitive global economy and to become responsible citizens in an environmentally vulnerable world. To succeed in today's society, students need to be effective problem solvers and critical thinkers, able to understand, question, and respond to the implications of technological innovation. Students who pursue careers in technology will also need these high-level skills to develop solutions to technological challenges or to provide the services required in their chosen fields. 

Technological education focuses on developing students' ability to work creatively and competently with technologies that are central to their lives. As they proceed through their elementary and secondary school education, students attain a level of technological literacy that will enhance their ability to succeed in their postsecondary studies or in the workplace. For students who do not choose to pursue careers in technology, technological education can provide knowledge and skills that will enhance their daily lives, whether by enabling them to work on home renovations or car repairs or by allowing them to pursue technological hobbies. 

Technological education promotes the integration of learning across subject disciplines. For example, when students design a product, they explore the social or human need that the product addresses (social science), the scientific principles involved in its design and construction (science), its dimensions and shape (mathematics), and the aesthetic qualities of its design (the arts). When they assess the impact that new technologies have had � or may have � on society, students are exploring historical or current events. When they consider how various technologies affect health and physical well-being, they are looking into aspects of health and physical education. Students apply business principles to the study of the production and marketing of products. They apply literacy skills to communicate design ideas, produce reports summarizing technological projects, and write instructions for the use of the products they create. Technological education also helps students develop research skills and fosters creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving. In addition, in its emphasis on innovation to meet human needs, it encourages global citizenship and promotes social, economic, and environmental awareness. 

Subject matter from any course in technological education can be combined with subject matter from one or more courses in other disciplines to create an interdisciplinary course. The policies and procedures regarding the development of interdisciplinary courses are outlined in the interdisciplinary studies curriculum policy document. 

The secondary school technological education curriculum is designed to build on the foundation of knowledge and skills provided by the elementary science and technology curriculum, particularly in its Understanding Structures and Mechanisms strand. In this continuum, there is a similar emphasis on foundational knowledge and skills (fundamentals), technological problem-solving skills and processes, and the relationship between technology, the environment, and society. 

THE GOALS OF TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION 

The fundamental purpose of the technological education program is to provide students with knowledge, skills, and attitudes that will enhance their ability to achieve success in secondary school, the workplace, postsecondary education or training, and daily life. 

The goals of the technological education curriculum are to enable students to: 
� gain an understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying technological education; 
� achieve the level of technological competence they will need in order to succeed in their postsecondary education or training programs or in the workplace; 
� develop a creative and flexible approach to problem solving that will help them address challenges in various areas throughout their lives; 
� develop the skills, including critical thinking skills, and the knowledge of strategies required to do research, conduct inquiries, and communicate findings accurately, ethically, and effectively; 
� develop lifelong learning habits that will help them adapt to technological advances in the changing workplace and world; 
� make connections that will help them take advantage of potential postsecondary educational and work opportunities. 

THE PHILOSOPHY OF BROAD-BASED TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION 

The philosophy that underlies broad-based technological education is that students learn best by doing. This curriculum therefore adopts an activity-based, project-driven approach that involves students in problem solving as they develop knowledge and skills and gain experience in the technological subject area of their choice. 

Rather than focusing on specific occupations, courses in this broad-based technology curriculum explore groups of related occupations and industry sectors within particular subject areas. So, for example, workplace preparation courses in construction technology enable students to acquire knowledge and skills related to carpentry, electrical/network cabling, heating and cooling, masonry, and plumbing. 

Broad-based technology courses enable students to develop a variety of transferable skills that will serve them well in a complex and ever-changing workplace. For example, problem-solving skills are transferable skills, because they can be applied in a wide variety of situations to solve problems of various kinds. Other transferable skills emphasized in this curriculum are the "Essential Skills" and work habits identified in the Ontario Skills Passport (see pp. 33�34) as the skills and habits that enable people to perform the tasks required in their jobs and to participate fully in the workplace and the community. 

FUNDAMENTAL TECHNOLOGICAL CONCEPTS 

This curriculum identifies a number of fundamental concepts that inform design and production in various areas of technology. To address technological challenges and solve problems effectively, students need to take the full range of these concepts and elements of technology into account. As they progress through their technological education courses, students will come to understand these concepts more deeply, and to work with them creatively as they confront new challenges. 

Fundamental Concepts 

Aesthetics: The aspects of a product, process, or service that make it pleasing to the human senses.

Control: The means by which a device or process is activated or regulated. 

Environmental sustainability: The creation of products or services and use of resources in a way that allows present needs to be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. An important related concept is that of environmental stewardship � the acceptance of responsibility for the sustainable use and treatment of land and other natural resources. 

Ergonomics: The design of a product, process, or service in a way that takes the user's well-being with respect to its use or delivery into account � that is, in a way that minimizes discomfort, risk of injury, and expenditure of energy. 

Fabrication/building/creation: The act or process of assembling components and/or materials and resources to create a product or service. 

Function: The use for which a product, process, or service is developed. 

Innovation: Original and creative thinking resulting in the effective design of a product or service. 

Material: Any substance or item used in the creation of a product or delivery of a service. 

Mechanism: A system of connected parts that allows a product to work or function. 

Power and energy: The resource that enables a mechanism to perform work. 

Safety: The care and consideration required to ensure that the product, process, or service will not cause harm. 

Structure: The essential physical or conceptual parts of a product, process, or service, including the way in which the parts are constructed or organized. 

Systems: The combinations of interrelated parts that make up a whole and that may be connected with other systems. 

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION 

Students 

Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning. Students who make the effort required to succeed in school and who are able to apply themselves will soon discover that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and will therefore be more motivated to work. There will be some students, however, who will find it more difficult to take responsibility for their learning because of special challenges they face. The attention, patience, and encouragement of teachers can be extremely important to the success of these students. However, taking responsibility for their own progress and learning is an important part of education for all students, regardless of their circumstances. 

Mastering the concepts and skills connected with technological education requires work, study, and the development of cooperative skills. In addition, students who actively pursue opportunities outside the classroom will extend and enrich their understanding of technology. Their understanding and skills will grow as they engage in recreational activities that involve technology (e.g., model building), reading related to technology (e.g., magazines, Internet sources), and learning about technological advances (e.g., attending technology fairs). 

Parents 

Parents1 have an important role to play in supporting student learning. Studies show that students perform better in school if their parents are involved in their education. By becoming familiar with the curriculum, parents can determine what is being taught in the courses their daughters and sons are taking and what they are expected to learn. This awareness will enhance parents' ability to discuss their children's work with them, to communicate with teachers, and to ask relevant questions about their children's progress. Knowledge of the expectations in the various courses will also help parents to interpret teachers' comments on student progress and to work with teachers to improve their children's learning. 

1. The word parents is used in this document to refer to parent(s) and guardian(s). 

Effective ways in which parents can support their children's learning include attending parent�teacher interviews, participating in parent workshops, becoming involved in school council activities (including becoming a school council member), and encouraging students to complete their assignments at home. In addition to supporting regular school activities, parents may wish to provide their daughters and sons with opportunities to question and reflect on current affairs, including news about developments in various areas of technology. 

Teachers 

Teachers and students have complementary responsibilities. Teachers develop appropriate instructional strategies to help students achieve the curriculum expectations, as well as appropriate methods for assessing and evaluating student learning. Teachers also support students in developing the reading, writing, oral communication, and numeracy skills needed for success in their courses. Teachers bring enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing different student needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student. 

Using a variety of instructional, assessment, and evaluation strategies, teachers provide numerous hands-on opportunities for students to develop and refine their problem-solving skills, critical and creative thinking skills, and communication skills, while discovering fundamental concepts through activities and projects, exploration, and research. The activities offered should enable students to relate and apply these concepts to the social, environmental, and economic conditions and concerns of the world in which they live. Opportunities to relate knowledge and skills to these wider contexts will motivate students to learn in a meaningful way and to become lifelong learners. 

Teachers need to help students understand that problem solving of any kind often requires a considerable expenditure of time and energy and a good deal of perseverance. Teachers also need to encourage students to reason, to explore alternative solutions, and to take the risks necessary to become successful problem solvers. 

Teachers are also responsible for ensuring the safety of students during classroom activities and for encouraging and motivating students to assume responsibility for their own safety and the safety of others. They must also ensure that students acquire the knowledge and skills needed for safe participation in all technological activities. 

Principals 

The principal works in partnership with teachers and parents to ensure that each student has access to the best possible educational experience. To support student learning, principals ensure that the Ontario curriculum is being properly implemented in all classrooms using a variety of instructional approaches. They also ensure that appropriate resources are made available for teachers and students. To enhance teaching and learning in all subjects, including technological education, principals promote learning teams and work with teachers to facilitate their participation in professional development activities. Principals are also responsible for ensuring that every student who has an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is receiving the modifications and/or accommodations described in his or her plan � in other words, for ensuring that the IEP is properly developed, implemented, and monitored. 

Community Partnerships 

Community partners in the area of technological education can be an important resource for schools and students. They can provide support for students in the classroom, and can be models of how the knowledge and skills acquired through the study of the curriculum relate to life beyond school. As mentors, they can enrich not only the educational experience of students, but also the life of the community. Schools can, for example, make arrangements with firms or other groups in the community to provide specialists in various areas and aspects of technology (e.g., engineers, technicians, technologists, tradespeople, or experts in construction, health care services, or green industries) to participate in in-class workshops for students based on topics, concepts, and skills from the curriculum. Such firms or groups may also be interested in working with schools to create opportunities for cooperative education and apprenticeships, in connection with the Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program (OYAP). 

Schools and school boards can play a role by coordinating efforts with community partners. They can involve colleges, universities, trade unions or professional organizations, local businesses, and community volunteers in supporting instruction and in promoting a focus on technological education in and outside the school. Postsecondary institutions and other community stakeholders can be included in events held at the school (such as parent education nights, technology skills competitions, and joint ventures), and school boards can collaborate with their community partners by providing educational opportunities within the community. 

THE PROGRAM IN TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION 

OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM 

The technological education curriculum in Grades 9�12 encompasses ten subject areas, as follows: 

Communications Technology 
Computer Technology
Construction Technology 
Green Industries 
Hairstyling and Aesthetics
Health Care  
Hospitality and Tourism
Manufacturing Technology 
Technological Design  
Transportation Technology 

The technological education program in Grades 11 and 12 is designed to enable students to select courses that relate to their interests and that will prepare them for further study or work in the technological field of their choice. The Grade 11 and 12 curriculum includes destination-related course types, including university/college preparation, college preparation, and workplace preparation courses, as well as open courses. The course types are defined as follows: 

� University/college preparation courses are designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to meet the entrance requirement for specific programs offered at universities and colleges. 

� College preparation courses are designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to meet the requirements for entrance to most college programs or for admission to apprenticeship or other training programs. 

� Workplace preparation courses are designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to meet the expectation of employers, if they plan to enter the workforce directly after graduation, or the requirements for admission to certain apprenticeship or other training programs. 

� Open courses are designed to broaden students' knowledge and skills in subjects that reflect their interests and prepare them for active and rewarding participation in society. They are not designed with the specific requirement of universities, colleges, or the workplace in mind. 

At least two of these course types are represented in most subject areas of the Grade 11�12 technological education curriculum (e.g., in computer technology, both university/college preparation and workplace preparation courses are provided). It should be noted that for students planning to pursue an apprenticeship pathway, either college preparation courses or workplace preparation courses may be the appropriate choice, depending on the subject area. 

In Grades 11 and 12, destination-related technological education courses may be delivered as courses that emphasize a particular area of the subject and/or as multiple-credit courses (see the following sections for detailed guidelines. Note that these options apply only to destination-related courses, not to open courses). The availability of these options allows school boards the flexibility to design programs that meet the specific needs of their school communities within the parameters of a standardized, rigorous curriculum for technological education for schools across the province. 

Although courses in technological education are optional, students should keep in mind that they can take any Grade 9�12 technological education course to fulfil the Group 3 additional compulsory credit requirement for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma.2 There is no restriction on the total number of technological education credits that students may earn in secondary school. 

2. To meet the Group 3 additional compulsory credit requirement, students have the choice of earning one credit for a course in technological education (Grades 9 to 12) or computer studies (Grades 10 to 12), or one credit for an additional course in science (Grade 11 or 12), or one credit for a cooperative education course. 

Grade 11 and 12 technological education courses are ideally suited for cooperative education programs and are often included in programs that lead to a diploma with a Specialist High Skills Major designation.

Options for Course Delivery in Grades 11 and 12 

Emphasis Courses 

In Grades 11 and 12, a destination-related3 broad-based technology course may be developed to emphasize a particular area of the subject (that is, an area related to a particular sector or particular occupations connected with the subject). For example, a workplace preparation course in computer technology could emphasize computer repair, or a university/college preparation course in technological design could be developed to emphasize apparel and textile design. However, an emphasis course must not entirely exclude other areas of the subject that relate to different sectors or occupations. 

3. In Grades 11 and 12, open courses may not be offered as emphasis courses.

The topics and applications that must be addressed in an emphasis course are evident from the course description and the expectations and examples provided for the broad-based course outlined in this document. For example, it is expected that students taking a one-credit (110-hour) Grade 11 university/college preparation course in green industries with an emphasis on forestry will nevertheless explore all areas of the green industries, including agribusiness, horticulture management and science, and landscaping architecture,4 and that the course will be delivered according to the philosophy of broad-based technological education outlined in this document (see p. 7). (Teachers will notice that the examples that accompany many of the specific expectations in courses outlined in this document are designed to illustrate the expectation from the perspective of several possible emphasis areas.) 
 
4. If the course is developed as a multiple-credit course, the first 110 hours of the course must be delivered in this way, addressing all areas within the subject. The remaining instructional time may be dedicated to the specified area of emphasis.

Regardless of the area emphasized in a course, students must be given the opportunity to achieve all of the expectations of the course outlined in this document. 

The emphasis courses that may be developed in each technological education subject can be identified, along with the course codes that must be assigned to them, from the list of Common Course Codes on the Ministry of Education's website (at www.edu.gov.on.ca). In school calendars, the course description for the emphasis course may be created by adding an additional sentence to the course description provided in this document. 

A student may take, and earn credit for the successful completion of, more than one course in any given technological education subject in Grade 11 and/or Grade 12. For example, a student may take two Grade 11 university/college preparation health care courses, one emphasizing dental services and another focusing on pharmacy services (these emphasis areas are specified on the ministry website). Similarly, a student might take the regular broad-based Grade 12 workplace preparation course in hospitality and tourism (as outlined in this document), as well as another Grade 12 hospitality and tourism workplace preparation course, developed on the basis of the same set of expectations but emphasizing baking. 

Multiple-Credit Courses 

A destination-related5 broad-based technology course in Grade 11 or 12 may be planned for up to 330 hours of scheduled instructional time (for which the student may earn a maximum of three credits) if the course is part of a Specialist High Skills Major program or school�work transition program, if it leads to an apprenticeship or certification program, or if it supports an articulation agreement for advanced standing or preferred entrance into a specialized program. The additional instructional time allows for the practice and refinement of skills needed to raise the quality of the student's performance to the level required for entry into a subsequent program or the workplace. The skills students develop in multiple-credit courses should reflect current industry practices and standards. 
 
5. In Grades 11 and 12, open courses may not be offered as multiple-credit courses. 

Instructional time may be increased by increments of 55 hours. For each additional 55 hours, students earn an additional half-credit, to a maximum of three credits. The number of additional credits and the nature of the knowledge and skills to be practised and refine during the additional instructional time must be established before the start of the course. 

Any destination-related course, including emphasis courses, may be delivered as a multiple-credit course. 

Half-Credit Courses 

The courses outlined in the technological education curriculum documents are designed as full-credit courses. However, with the exception of the Grade 12 university/college preparation courses, they may also be delivered as half-credit courses. 

Half-credit courses, which require a minimum of fifty-five hours of scheduled instructional time, must adhere to the following conditions: 

� The two half-credit courses created from a full course must together contain all of the expectations of the full course. The expectations for each half-credit course must be drawn from all strands of the full course and must be divided in a manner that best enables students to achieve the required knowledge and skills in the allotted time. 
� A course that is a prerequisite for another course in the secondary curriculum may be offered as two half-credit courses, but students must successfully complete both parts of the course to fulfil the prerequisite. (Students are not required to complete both parts unless the course is a prerequisite for another course they wish to take.) 
� The title of each half-credit course must include the designation Part 1 or Part 2. A half credit (0.5) will be recorded in the credit-value column of both the report card and the Ontario Student Transcript. 

Boards will ensure that all half-credit courses comply with the conditions described above, and will report all half-credit courses to the ministry annually in the School October Report. 

CURRICULUM EXPECTATIONS 

The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and skills that students are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class work, on tests, and in various other activities on which their achievement is assessed and evaluated. 

Two sets of expectations are listed for each strand, or broad curriculum area, of each course. (The strands are numbered A, B, C, D, and, in some courses, E.) 
� The overall expectations describe in general terms the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate by the end of each course. 
� The specific expectations describe the expected knowledge and skills in greater detail. The specific expectations are grouped under numbered subheadings, each of which indicates the strand and the overall expectation to which the subgrouping of specific expectations corresponds (e.g., "B2" indicates that the group relates to overall expectation 2 in strand B). The subheadings may serve as a guide for teachers as they plan learning activities for their students. 

The organization of expectations into strands and subgroupings is not meant to imply that the expectations in any one strand or group are achieved independently of the expectations in the other strands or groups. The strands and subgroupings are used merely to help teachers focus on particular aspects of knowledge and skills as they develop various learning activities for their students. The concepts, content, and skills identified in the different strands of each course should, wherever appropriate, be integrated in instruction throughout the course. 

Many of the specific expectations are accompanied by examples, which are given in parentheses and italicized. These examples are meant to illustrate the kind of knowledge or skill, the specific area of learning, the depth of learning, and/or the level of complexity that the expectation entails. In addition, the examples provided within a broad-based technological education course may collectively reflect the range of areas represented within a given subject (e.g., a construction technology course may include examples that are applicable to plumbing, electrical/network cabling, masonry, heating and cooling, and carpentry). 

The examples are intended as a guide for teachers rather than as an exhaustive or mandatory list. Teachers can choose to use the examples that are appropriate for their classrooms or they may develop their own approaches that reflect a similar level of complexity. Whatever the specific ways in which the requirements outlined in the expectations are implemented in the classroom, they must, wherever possible, be inclusive and reflect the diversity of the student population and the population of the province.

STRANDS IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM

The overall and specific expectations for each course in the technological education curriculum are typically organized in four distinct but related strands. As students move up through the grades, the expectations within these strands will increase in complexity and depth. These strands are as follows: 

Fundamentals: Students develop foundational knowledge and skills related to the design and fabrication of products or the provision of services in the particular broad-based technological subject area. 

Skills: Students develop the technological skills required for responding to a variety of practical challenges. 

Technology, the Environment, and Society: Students develop an understanding of the interrelationship between the technology or industry sector and the environment, and between the technology and various aspects of society. (In subject areas that relate to services, this strand is entitled Industry Practices, the Environment, and Society.) 

Professional Practice and Career Opportunities: Students develop an understanding of health and safety standards in the industry, professional concerns and issues, and the Essential Skills and work habits valued in the sector, and explore career opportunities and the education and training required for them. 

(Sample Page Diagram, page 20)

Technological education courses are typically organized into four strands, numbered A, B, C, and D. 

The overall expectations describe in general terms the knowledge and skills students are expected to demonstrate by the end of each course. Two or more overall expectations are provided for each strand in every course. The numbering of overall expectations indicates the strand to which they belong (e.g., B1�B4 are the overall expectations for strand B). 

The overall expectations describe in general terms the knowledge and skills students are expected to demonstrate by the end of each course. Two or more overall expectations are provided for each strand in every course. The numbering of overall expectations indicates the strand to which they belong (e.g., B1�B4 are the overall expectations for strand B). 

A numbered subheading identifies each group of specific expectations and relates to one particular overall expectation (e.g.,"B1. Design and Planning Process" relates to overall expectation B1). 

The specific expectations describe the expected knowledge and skills in greater detail. The expectation number identifies the strand to which the expectation belongs and the overall expectation to which it relates (e.g., B1.1, B1.2, B1.3, and so on, relate to the first overall expectation in strand B). 

The examples help to clarify the requirement specified in the expectation and to suggest its intended depth and level of complexity. The examples are illustrations only, not requirements. They appear in parentheses and are set in italics.
PROBLEM SOLVING IN TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION 

An approach to learning that emphasizes problem solving is the best way to prepare students for the challenges they will face in the world beyond school. In the workplace, projects or tasks may not always be clearly defined or have prescribed solutions. Students who have a strong background in problem solving will be more confident and better equipped to address new challenges in a variety of contexts. 

Learning through problem solving will help students appreciate that all challenges � whether large or small, complex or simple � are most effectively resolved when approached systematically, using a simple method or a more comprehensive process, depending on the nature of the problem. 

The range of challenges students encounter in technological education is wide and varied. At one end are simple problems for which there is likely to be only one solution � for example, substituting a part to fix an obvious fault. At the other end are complex challenges � for example, devising a solution to an identified human need � for which there could be various different solutions and which call for a detailed process that may involve consultations with stakeholders to clearly define the problem and determine criteria for its solution, and the design and testing of several potential solutions. In many cases, the nature of the problem, and the problem-solving process required to solve it, fall somewhere between these two extremes. 

Technological education teachers can guide students through problem solving by helping them understand the nature and scope of a problem and the type of approach or method best suited to address it. They can also remind students that there is often more than one solution, give them the freedom to explore ideas, and encourage them to retrace steps and persist in their efforts when they encounter obstacles. 

Problem-Solving Methods and Approaches 

Problem-solving processes share at least some of a number of systematic steps � for example, identifying the problem, analysing the situation, considering possible solutions, selecting the best solution, testing and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, and reviewing or repeating steps as necessary to improve the solution. Among the various problem-solving methods and approaches that may be employed to address the range of problems students will encounter in technological education are those listed below. This list is not comprehensive, and may be supplemented by various other methods in the classroom. 

Parts Substitution 

Perhaps the most basic of all the problem-solving methods, "parts substitution" simply requires that parts be substituted until the problem is solved. Although it is not the most scientific method of problem solving, there may be no other alternative if tests do not indicate what could be causing the problem. 

Diagnostics 

An example of a diagnostic problem-solving method is troubleshooting an engine fault in an automobile. After identifying the general problem, the technician would run tests to pinpoint the fault. The test results would be used either as a guide for further testing or for replacement of a part, which would also need to be tested. This process continues until the solution is found and the car is running properly. 

Reverse Engineering 

Reverse engineering is the process of discovering the technological principles underlying the design of a device by taking the device apart, or carefully tracing its workings or its circuitry. It is useful when students are attempting to build something for which they have no formal drawings or schematics. 

Divide and Conquer 

"Divide and conquer" is the technique of breaking down a problem into subproblems, then breaking the subproblems down even further until each of them is simple enough to be solved. Divide and conquer may be applied to allow groups of students to tackle subproblems of a larger problem, or when a problem is so large that its solution cannot be visualized without breaking it down into smaller components. 

Extreme Cases 

Considering "extreme cases" � envisioning the problem in a greatly exaggerated or greatly simplified form, or testing using an extreme condition � can often help to pinpoint a problem. An example of the extreme-case method is purposely inputting an extremely high number to test a computer program. 

Trial and Error 

The trial-and-error method involves trying different approaches until a solution is found. It is often used as a last resort when other methods have been exhausted. 

The Design Process 

In many technological fields, open-ended problem-solving processes that involve the full planning and development of products or services to meet identified needs are often referred to as the "design process". A design process involves a sequence of steps, such as the following: 
� Analyse the context and background, and clearly define the problem or challenge. 
� Conduct research to determine design criteria, financial or other constraints, and availability of materials. 
� Generate ideas for potential solutions, using processes such as brainstorming and sketching. 
� Choose the best solution. 
� Build a prototype or model. 
� Test and evaluate the solution. 
� Repeat steps as necessary to modify the design or correct faults. 
� Reflect and report on the process.

Steps in the Design Process (Flow Chart omitted see page 23 -Text only)

Any steps can be revisited:
Clearly define the problem or challenge
Conduct research
Generate ideas for potential solutions
Choose the best solution
Build a prototype or model
Test and evaluate the solution
Reflect and report on the process

Although processes such as this involve a framework of sequential steps, they are typically iterative processes that may require a retracing of steps, diversions to solve specific problems along the way, or even a return to the start of the process if it becomes clear that the situation needs to be clarified and the problem redefined. Problem solvers soon discover that the process calls for an open mind, the freedom to be creative, and a great deal of patience and persistence.

ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT 

BASIC CONSIDERATIONS 

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students' strengths and weaknesses in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students' needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices. 

Assessment is the process of gathering information from a variety of sources (including assignments, day-to-day observations, conversations or conferences, demonstrations, projects, performances, and tests) that accurately reflects how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a course. As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts towards improvement. Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality. 

Assessment and evaluation will be based on the provincial curriculum expectations and the achievement levels outlined in this document. 

In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evaluation strategies that: 
� address both what students learn and how well they learn; 
� are based both on the categories of knowledge and skills and on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart on pages 28�29; 
� are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning; 
� are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students; � are fair to all students; 
� accommodate the needs of students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan; 
� accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction (English or French); 
� ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement; 
� promote students' ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals; 
� include the use of samples of students' work that provide evidence of their achievement; 
� are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the course or the school term and at other appropriate points throughout the school year. 

Evaluation of Achievement of Overall Expectations 

All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students' achievement of the overall expectations. A student's achievement of the overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of his or her achievement of related specific expectations. The overall expectations are broad in nature, and the specific expectations define the particular content or scope of the knowledge and skills referred to in the overall expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of the overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment (e.g., through direct observation) but not necessarily evaluated. 

Levels of Achievement 

The characteristics given in the achievement chart (pp. 28�29) for level 3 represent the "provincial standard" for achievement of the expectations in a course. A complete picture of overall achievement at level 3 in a course in technological education can be constructed by reading from top to bottom in the shaded column of the achievement chart, headed "70�79% (Level 3)". Parents of students achieving at level 3 can be confident that their children will be prepared for work in subsequent courses. 

Level 1 identifies achievement that falls much below the provincial standard, while still reflecting a passing grade. Level 2 identifies achievement that approaches the standard. Level 4 identifies achievement that surpasses the standard. It should be noted that achievement at level 4 does not mean that the student has achieved expectations beyond those specified for a particular course. It indicates that the student has achieved all or almost all of the expectations for that course, and that he or she demonstrates the ability to use the specified knowledge and skills in more sophisticated ways than a student achieving at level 3. 

THE ACHIEVEMENT CHART FOR TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION 

The achievement chart that follows identifies four categories of knowledge and skills in technological education. The achievement chart is a standard province-wide guide to be used by teachers. It enables teachers to make judgements about student work that are based on clear performance standards and on a body of evidence collected over time.

The purpose of the achievement chart is to: 
� provide a common framework that encompasses all curriculum expectations for all courses outlined in this document; 
� guide the development of high-quality assessment tasks and tools (including rubrics); 
� help teachers to plan instruction for learning; 
� assist teachers in providing meaningful feedback to students; 
� provide various categories and criteria with which to assess and evaluate students' learning. 

Categories of Knowledge and Skills 

The categories, defined by clear criteria, represent four broad areas of knowledge and skills within which the subject expectations for any given course are organized. The four categories should be considered as interrelated, reflecting the wholeness and interconnectedness of learning. 

The categories of knowledge and skills are described as follows: 

Knowledge and Understanding. Subject-specific content acquired in each course (knowledge), and the comprehension of its meaning and significance (understanding). 

Thinking. The use of critical and creative thinking skills and/or processes, as follows: 
� planning skills (e.g., identifying the problem, selecting strategies and resources, scheduling) 
� processing skills (e.g., analysing and interpreting information, reasoning, generating and evaluating solutions, forming conclusions) 
� critical/creative thinking processes (e.g., problem-solving, design, and decision-making processes) 

Communication. The conveying of meaning through various forms, as follows: 
� oral (e.g., role play, discussion, presentation) 
� written (e.g., design briefs, work orders, technical reports) 
� visual (e.g., technical drawings, flow charts, graphics) 

Application. The use of knowledge and skills to make connections within and between various contexts. 

Teachers will ensure that student work is assessed and/or evaluated in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories, and that achievement of particular expectations is considered within the appropriate categories. 

Criteria 

Within each category in the achievement chart, criteria are provided that are subsets of the knowledge and skills that define each category. For example, in Knowledge and Understanding, the criteria are "knowledge of content (e.g., facts, equipment, terminology, materials)" and "understanding of content (e.g., procedures, technological concepts, processes, industry standards)". The criteria identify the aspects of student performance that are assessed and/or evaluated, and serve as guides to what to look for. 

Descriptors 

A "descriptor" indicates the characteristic of the student's performance, with respect to a particular criterion, on which assessment or evaluation is focused. In the achievement chart, effectiveness is the descriptor used for each criterion in the Thinking, Communication, and Application categories. What constitutes effectiveness in any given performance task will vary with the particular criterion being considered. Assessment of effectiveness may therefore focus on a quality such as appropriateness, clarity, accuracy, precision, logic, relevance, significance, fluency, flexibility, depth, or breadth, as appropriate for the particular criterion. For example, in the Thinking category, assessment of effectiveness might focus on the degree of relevance or depth apparent in an analysis; in the Communication category, on clarity of expression or logical organization of information and ideas; or in the Application category, on appropriateness or breadth in the making of connections. Similarly, in the Knowledge and Understanding category, assessment of knowledge might focus on accuracy, and assessment of understanding might focus on the depth of an explanation. Descriptors help teachers to focus their assessment and evaluation on specific knowledge and skills for each category and criterion, and help students to better understand exactly what is being assessed and evaluated. 

Qualifiers 

A specific "qualifier" is used to define each of the four levels of achievement � that is, limited for level 1, some for level 2, considerable for level 3, and a high degree or thorough for level 4. A qualifier is used along with a descriptor to produce a description of performance at a particular level. For example, the description of a student's performance at level 3 with respect to the first criterion in the Thinking category would be: "the student uses planning skills with considerable effectiveness". 

The descriptions of the levels of achievement given in the chart should be used to identify the level at which the student has achieved the expectations. In all of their courses, students should be given numerous and varied opportunities to demonstrate the full extent of their achievement of the curriculum expectations across all four categories of knowledge and skills.

Note: A student whose achievement is below 50% at the end of a course will not obtain a credit for the course.  

EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT 

Student achievement must be communicated formally to students and parents by means of the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9�12. The report card provides a record of the student's achievement of the curriculum expectations in every course, at particular points in the school year or semester, in the form of a percentage grade. The percentage grade represents the quality of the student's overall achievement of the expectations for the course and reflects the corresponding level of achievement as described in the achievement chart for the discipline. 

A final grade is recorded for every course, and a credit is granted and recorded for every course in which the student's grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for each course in Grades 9 to 12 will be determined as follows: 
� Seventy per cent of the grade will be based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade should reflect the student's most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement. 
� Thirty per cent of the grade will be based on a final evaluation in the form of an examination, performance, essay, and/or other method of evaluation suitable to the course content and administered towards the end of the course. 

REPORTING ON DEMONSTRATED LEARNING SKILLS 

The report card provides a record of the learning skills demonstrated by the student in every course, in the following five categories: Works Independently, Teamwork, Organization, Work Habits, and Initiative. The learning skills are evaluated using a four-point scale (E�Excellent, G�Good, S�Satisfactory, N�Needs Improvement). The separate evaluation and reporting of the learning skills in these five areas reflect their critical role in students' achievement of the curriculum expectations. To the extent possible, the evaluation of learning skills, apart from any that may be included as part of a curriculum expectation in a course, should not be considered in the determination of percentage grades. 

SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR PROGRAM PLANNING 

Teachers who are planning a program in technological education must take into account considerations in a number of important areas, including those discussed below. 

INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES 

Technological education involves knowing and doing, and teaching and learning approaches should address both areas. Teachers should use projects as a major means of achieving course expectations, and students should be provided with a combination of information and experiences that will prepare them to make informed choices about the use of various technologies, to use technology wisely and well, and to solve technological problems. 

Students learn best when they are engaged in learning in a variety of ways. Technological education courses lend themselves to a wide range of approaches in that they require students to discuss issues, solve problems, plan solutions, participate in development of solutions, conduct research, think critically, and work cooperatively. When students are engaged in active and experiential learning strategies, they tend to retain knowledge for longer periods and to develop, acquire, and integrate key skills more completely. 

Programs in technological education should involve an open, collaborative, activity-based approach to teaching that accommodates students' interests, aspirations, and learning styles. Activities should be designed to include both individual and team approaches, as technological projects in the workplace often require individuals to work collaboratively while undertaking a variety of roles and tasks. Students should be given opportunities to work both independently and with teacher direction, and to learn through the study of examples followed by practice. There is no single correct way to teach or to learn, and the strategies used in the classroom should vary according to the curriculum expectations and the needs of the students. Problem solving and/or the design process should be an integral part of all broad-based technological education. Teachers should work collaboratively with colleagues to plan and deliver the technological education curriculum. Individual teachers can contribute their expertise in particular areas of technology to ensure the successful implementation of the curriculum. 

Some of the teaching and learning strategies that are suitable to material taught in technological education employ scaffolding. Scaffolding is an instructional approach that involves breaking down tasks so that students can concentrate on specific, manageable objectives and gradually build understanding and skill, with the aid of modelling by the teacher and ample opportunity for practice. Scaffolding provides students with a supportive structure within which to learn. 

Some of the concepts taught in technological education involve abstract thinking, which can be difficult for many students. Role playing is an approach teachers can employ to help students internalize new concepts. Learning processes that include opportunities for physical activity by students can lead to better understanding and longer retention of concepts. The use of kinesthetic learning can be an effective way to adapt technological education to the varied learning styles that students may demonstrate. 

When students work collaboratively they often accomplish more than when they work individually. Group activities, when used in a structured way, can enhance learning and foster positive attitudes. When working in a team, each student should have a specific role and be actively involved in the task. It is important to give students opportunities to take on different roles, from one project to another or in the course of a large project. 

Students' attitudes towards technological education can have a significant effect on their achievement of expectations. Teaching methods and learning activities that encourage students to recognize the value and relevance of what they are learning for work and their lives beyond school will go a long way towards motivating students to work and learn effectively. 

The study of current events related to technologies in various industries, including emerging technologies, should inform the technological education curriculum, enhancing both the relevance and the immediacy of the program. Discussion of current events related to various technologies and inclusion of these topics in daily lessons will stimulate students' interest and curiosity and also help them connect what they are learning in class with real-world events or situations. The study of events in industry sectors and technological developments in the world needs to be thought of not as a separate topic removed from the program but as an effective instructional strategy for implementing many of the expectations found in the curriculum. 

HEALTH AND SAFETY IN TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION 

Health and safety is of paramount importance in technological education. In every course, students must be made aware that health and safety is everyone's responsibility � at home, at school, and in the workplace. Before using any piece of equipment or any tool, students must be able to demonstrate knowledge of how the equipment or tool works and of the procedures they must follow to ensure its safe use. Personal protective gear must be worn as required. 

Classroom practice and all aspects of the learning environment must comply with relevant municipal, provincial, or federal health and safety legislation, including the following: 
� the Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Act 
� the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) 
� the Food and Drugs Act 
� the Ontario Health Protection and Promotion Act 
� the Ontario Building Code 
� the Occupational Health and Safety Act 
� local by-laws 

Teachers should make use of all available and relevant resources to make students sufficiently aware of the importance of health and safety. These resources include: 

� Live Safe! Work Smart! � website and related resources 
� Passport to Safety � website and related resources 
� Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) 
� Industrial Accident Prevention Association (IAPA) 
� Ontario Ministry of Labour (MOL) 
� Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS) 
� appropriate Safe Workplace Associations (SWAs) and clinics, such as the Construction Safety Association of Ontario (CSAO), the Ontario Service Safety Alliance (OSSA), the Transportation Health and Safety Association of Ontario(THSAO), the Electrical &amp; Utilities Safety Association (E&amp;USA), the Workers Health &amp; Safety Centre (WHSC), and the Occupational Health Clinics for Ontario Workers (OHCOW) 

Teachers are responsible for ensuring the safety of students during technology lab, shop, and classroom activities. Health and safety issues must also be addressed when learning involves cooperative education and other workplace experiences (see p. 43). Teachers need to encourage and motivate students to assume responsibility for their own safety and the safety of others, and they must help students develop the knowledge and skills needed for safe participation in all technology-related activities. For these reasons, teachers must model safe practices at all times and communicate safety expectations to students in accordance with school board policies and procedures, Ministry of Education policies, and Ministry of Labour regulations. 

THE ONTARIO SKILLS PASSPORT AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS 

Teachers planning programs in technological education need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP). The OSP is a bilingual web-based resource that enhances the relevance of classroom learning for students and strengthens school�work connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text, Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service. The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students' demonstration of these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can use the OSP to assess, practise, and build their Essential Skills and work habits and transfer them to a job or further education or training. 

The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their jobs and adapt to workplace change. For further information on the OSP and the Essential Skills, visit http://skills.edu.gov.on.ca. 

THE ROLE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY IN TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION 

Information and communications technologies (ICT) provide a range of tools that can significantly extend and enrich teachers' instructional strategies and support student learning. ICT tools include multimedia resources, databases, Internet websites, digital cameras, and word-processing programs. Tools such as these can help students to collect, organize, and sort the data they gather and to write, edit, and present reports on their findings. Information and communications technologies can also be used to connect students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into the local classroom. 

Whenever appropriate, therefore, students should be encouraged to use ICT to support and communicate their learning. For example, students working individually or in groups can use computer technology and/or Internet websites to gain access to technical information in Canada and around the world. Students can also use digital cameras and projectors to design and present the results of their research to their classmates. 

Although the Internet is a powerful learning tool, there are potential risks attached to its use. All students must be made aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible use, as well as of the potential for abuse of this technology, particularly when it is used to bully or promote hatred. 

Teachers will find the various ICT tools useful in their teaching practice, both for whole-class instruction and for the design of curriculum units that contain varied approaches to learning to meet diverse student needs. 

PLANNING TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS 

Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs. They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with special education resource teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal.

Special Education Transformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs with the Recommendations of the Working Table on Special Education, 2006 endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for students with special education needs in all disciplines. Those beliefs are as follows: 

� All students can succeed. 
� Universal design6 and differentiated instruction7 are effective and interconnected means of meeting the learning or productivity needs of any group of students. 
� Successful instructional practices are founded on evidence-based research, tempered by experience. 
� Classroom teachers are key educators for a student's literacy and numeracy development. 
� Each student has his or her own unique patterns of learning. 
� Classroom teachers need the support of the larger community to create a learning environment that supports students with special education needs. 
� Fairness is not sameness. 

6. The goal of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is to create a learning environment that is open and accessible to all students, regardless of age, skills, or situation. Instruction based on principles of universal design is flexible and supportive, can be adjusted to meet different student needs, and enables all students to access the curriculum as fully as possible. 
7. Differentiated instruction is effective instruction that shapes each student's learning experience in response to his or her particular learning preferences, interests, and readiness to learn. 

In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of strengths and needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest possible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs that accommodate a diversity of learning needs. 

In planning technological education courses for students with special education needs, teachers should begin by examining the current achievement level of the individual student, the strengths and learning needs of the student, and the knowledge and skills that all students are expected to demonstrate at the end of the course, in order to determine which of the following options is appropriate for the student: 

� no accommodations8 or modified expectations; or 
� accommodations only; or 
� modified expectations, with the possibility of accommodations; or 
� alternative expectations, which are not derived from the curriculum expectations for a course and which constitute alternative programs and/or courses. 

8. "Accommodations" refers to individualized teaching and assessment strategies, human supports, and/or individualized equipment.

If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the relevant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative programs and/or courses,9 can be found in The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A Resource Guide, 2004 (referred to hereafter as the IEP Resource Guide, 2004). For a detailed discussion of the ministry's requirements for IEPs, see Individual Education Plans: Standards for Development, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000 (referred to hereafter as IEP Standards, 2000). (Both documents are available at www.edu.gov.on.ca.) 

9. Alternative programs are identified on the IEP form by the term "alternative (ALT)". 

Students Requiring Accommodations Only 

Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student's learning must be identified in his or her IEP (see IEP Standards, 2000, p. 11). A student's IEP is likely to reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. 

Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the diverse needs of learners. 

There are three types of accommodations: 
� Instructional accommodations are changes in teaching strategies, including styles of presentation, methods of organization, or use of technology and multimedia. 
� Environmental accommodations are changes that the student may require in the classroom and/or school environment, such as preferential seating or special lighting. 
� Assessment accommodations are changes in assessment procedures that enable the student to demonstrate his or her learning, such as allowing additional time to complete tests or assignments or permitting oral responses to test questions (see page 29 of the IEP Resource Guide, 2004, for more examples). 

If a student requires "accommodations only" in technological education courses, assessment and evaluation of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expectations and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student's Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of accommodations will be included. 

Students Requiring Modified Expectations 

Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations. Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achievements and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations. 

It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student's IEP, the extent to which expectations have been modified. As noted in Section 7.12 of the ministry's policy document Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999, the principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and the student.

When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course, the modified expectations should identify how the required knowledge and skills differ from those identified in the course expectations. When modifications are so extensive that achievement of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely to result in a credit, the expectations should specify the precise requirements or tasks on which the student's performance will be evaluated and which will be used to generate the course mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. 

Modified expectations indicate the knowledge and/or skills the student is expected to demonstrate and have assessed in each reporting period (IEP Standards, 2000, pp. 10 and 11). The student's learning expectations must be reviewed in relation to the student's progress at least once every reporting period, and must be updated as necessary (IEP Standards, 2000, p. 11). 

If a student requires modified expectations in technological education courses, assessment and evaluation of his or her achievement will be based on the learning expectations identified in the IEP and on the achievement levels outlined in this document. If some of the student's learning expectations for a course are modified but the student is working towards a credit for the course, it is sufficient simply to check the IEP box on the Provincial Report Card. If, however, the student's learning expectations are modified to such an extent that the principal deems that a credit will not be granted for the course, the IEP box must be checked and the appropriate statement from the Guide to the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9�12, 1999 (p. 8) must be inserted. The teacher's comments should include relevant information on the student's demonstrated learning of the modified expectations, as well as next steps for the student's learning in the course. 

PROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS 

Ontario schools have some of the most multilingual student populations in the world. The first language of approximately 20 per cent of the students in Ontario's English language schools is a language other than English. Ontario's linguistic heritage includes several Aboriginal languages and many African, Asian, and European languages. It also includes some varieties of English � also referred to as dialects � that differ significantly from the English required for success in Ontario schools. Many English language learners were born in Canada and have been raised in families and communities in which languages other than English, or varieties of English that differ from the language used in the classroom, are spoken. Other English language learners arrive in Ontario as newcomers from other countries; they may have experience of highly sophisticated educational systems, or they may have come from regions where access to formal schooling was limited. 

When they start school in Ontario, many of these students are entering a new linguistic and cultural environment. All teachers share in the responsibility for these students' English language development. 

English language learners (students who are learning English as a second or additional language in English language schools) bring a rich diversity of background knowledge and experience to the classroom. These students' linguistic and cultural backgrounds not only support their learning in their new environment but also become a cultural asset in the classroom community. Teachers will find positive ways to incorporate this diversity into their instructional programs and into the classroom environment. 

Most English language learners in Ontario schools have an age-appropriate proficiency in their first language. Although they need frequent opportunities to use English at school, there are important educational and social benefits associated with continued development of their first language while they are learning English. Teachers need to encourage parents to continue to use their own language at home in rich and varied ways as a foundation for language and literacy development in English. It is also important for teachers to find opportunities to bring students' languages into the classroom, using parents and community members as a resource. 

During their first few years in Ontario schools, English language learners may receive support through one of two distinct programs from teachers who specialize in meeting their language-learning needs: 

English as a Second Language (ESL) programs are for students born in Canada or newcomers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools. 

English Literacy Development (ELD) programs are primarily for newcomers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools, and who arrive with significant gaps in their education. These students generally come from countries where access to education is limited or where there are limited opportunities to develop language and literacy skills in any language. Some Aboriginal students from remote communities in Ontario may also have had limited opportunities for formal schooling, and they also may benefit from ELD instruction. 

In planning programs for students with linguistic backgrounds other than English, teachers need to recognize the importance of the orientation process, understanding that every learner needs to adjust to the new social environment and language in a unique way and at an individual pace. For example, students who are in an early stage of English-language acquisition may go through a "silent period" during which they closely observe the interactions and physical surroundings of their new learning environment. They may use body language rather than speech or they may use their first language until they have gained enough proficiency in English to feel confident of their interpretations and responses. Students thrive in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment that nurtures their self-confidence while they are receiving focused literacy instruction. When they are ready to participate, in paired, small-group, or whole-class activities, some students will begin by using a single word or phrase to communicate a thought, while others will speak quite fluently. 

With exposure to the English language in a supportive learning environment, most young children will develop oral fluency quite quickly, making connections between concepts and skills acquired in their first language and similar concepts and skills presented in English. However, oral fluency is not a good indicator of a student's knowledge of vocabulary or sentence structure, reading comprehension, or other aspects of language proficiency that play an important role in literacy development and academic success. Research has shown that it takes five to seven years for most English language learners to catch up to their English-speaking peers in their ability to use English for academic purposes. Moreover, the older the children are when they arrive, the greater the amount of language knowledge and skills that they have to catch up on, and the more direct support they require from their teachers. 

Responsibility for students' English-language development is shared by the classroom teacher, the ESL/ELD teacher (where available), and other school staff. Volunteers and peers may also be helpful in supporting English language learners in the language classroom. Teachers must adapt the instructional program in order to facilitate the success of these students in their classrooms. Appropriate adaptations include: 

� modification of some or all of the subject expectations so that they are challenging but attainable for the learner at his or her present level of English proficiency, given the necessary support from the teacher; 
� use of a variety of instructional strategies (e.g., extensive use of visual cues, graphic organizers, and scaffolding; previewing of textbooks; pre-teaching of key vocabulary; peer tutoring; strategic use of students' first languages); 
� use of a variety of learning resources (e.g., visual material, simplified text, bilingual dictionaries, and materials that reflect cultural diversity); 
� use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting of extra time; use of oral interviews, demonstrations or visual representations, or tasks requiring completion of graphic organizers or cloze sentences instead of essay questions and other assessment tasks that depend heavily on proficiency in English). 

When learning expectations in any course are modified for an English language learner (whether the student is enrolled in an ESL or ELD course or not), this information must be clearly indicated on the student's report card. 

Although the degree of program adaptation required will decrease over time, students who are no longer receiving ESL or ELD support may still need some program adaptations to be successful. 

For further information on supporting English language learners, refer to The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 9�12: English as a Second Language and English Literacy Development, 2007; English Language Learners � ESL and ELD Programs and Services: Policies and Procedures for Ontario Elementary and Secondary Schools, Kindergarten to Grade 12, 2007; and the resource guides Supporting English Language Learners with Limited Prior Schooling: A Practical Guide for Ontario Educators, Grades 3 to 12, 2008 and Many Roots, Many Voices: Supporting English Language Learners in Every Classroom, 2005. 

ANTIDISCRIMINATION EDUCATION IN TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION 

The implementation of antidiscrimination principles in education influences all aspects of school life. It promotes a school climate that encourages all students to work to attain high standards, affirms the worth of all students, and helps students strengthen their sense of identity and develop a positive self-image. It encourages staff and students alike to value and show respect for diversity in the school and the wider society. It requires schools to adopt measures to provide a safe environment for learning, free from harassment, violence, and expressions of hate. 

Antidiscrimination education encourages students to think critically about themselves and others in the world around them in order to promote fairness, healthy relationships, and active, responsible citizenship. 

Schools have the responsibility to ensure that school�community interaction reflects the diversity in the local community and wider society. Consideration should be given to a variety of strategies for communicating and working with parents and community members from diverse groups, in order to ensure their participation in such school activities as technology fairs, plays, and teacher interviews. Families new to Canada, who may be unfamiliar with the Ontario school system, or parents of Aboriginal students may need special outreach and encouragement in order to feel comfortable in their interactions with the school. 

When planning instructional activities for technological education, teachers should base their decisions on the needs of students, taking into consideration the diversity of their abilities, backgrounds, interests, and learning styles. Teaching strategies, assessment and evaluation materials, and the classroom environment should be designed to value the experiences and contributions of all people. 

Participation rates in some technological education subjects tend to be higher for male students than female students. To encourage greater participation among female students, it may be helpful to offer more projects and activities that have socially meaningful applications. 

For example, projects to develop assistive devices, as opposed to the more traditional activity of creating robotic arms, have proved successful in engaging the interest of female students. Similarly, projects involving the construction of playground equipment as opposed to the more traditional sheds and building structures may hold more appeal for young women. Providing outreach programs and establishing study groups for young women may help them develop greater self-confidence in technological education. Technology fairs and showcase events can introduce all students to a wide range of technology activities, and may encourage an interest in technological education. Offering choices from a range of instructional activities or allowing students to select their own projects can help motivate all the students in a classroom by acknowledging the differences in their experiences, attitudes, and interests. 

It is important to have open and frank discussions about the kind of workplace environment students are likely to encounter in technological fields. Inviting female and visible minority role models who have had successful careers in various technology sectors to be guest speakers, and involving female and visible minority senior students as mentors, can have a very positive impact on students. Also, exploring strategies that would enable those with different learning and social styles, including Aboriginal students and students from other minority groups, to work effectively together will help establish a more inclusive working environment.

ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION IN TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION 

Environmental education is education about the environment, for the environment, and in the environment that promotes an understanding of, rich and active experience in, and an appreciation for the dynamic interactions of: 

� the Earth's physical and biological systems 
� the dependency of our social and economic systems on these natural systems 
� the scientific and human dimensions of environmental issues 
� the positive and negative consequences, both intended and unintended, of the interactions between human-created and natural systems. 

Shaping Our Schools, Shaping Our Future: Environmental Education in Ontario Schools (June 2007), p. 6 

As noted in Shaping Our Schools, Shaping Our Future, environmental education "is the responsibility of the entire education community. It is a content area and can be taught. It is an approach to critical thinking, citizenship, and personal responsibility, and can be modelled. It is a context that can enrich and enliven education in all subject areas and offer students the opportunity to develop a deeper connection with themselves, their role in society, and their interdependence on one another and the Earth's natural systems" (p. 10). 

There are many opportunities to integrate environmental education into the teaching of technological education. In each of the technological education courses, the expectations in the Technology/Industry Practices, the Environment, and Society strand allow students to develop critical thinking skills and an understanding of responsible practice with respect to the environmental implications of the technology they are studying. Students analyse the impact of technology on the environment and learn about the safe handling and disposal of materials and substances used in the development of products and the provision of services. In this way, students are able to explore how simple human interactions with the environment can have significant consequences. Students will be expected to actively engage in developing and implementing strategies to reduce, reuse, and recycle materials and products, and will learn about government agencies and community partners that have developed relevant opportunities to support such practices. By identifying and implementing measures to reduce the negative effects of technology on the environment, students will be contributing to responsible environmental stewardship. 

The dynamic relationships resulting from human interaction with the environment provide a rich context for developing authentic learning activities in technological education courses. Technological education projects can readily be designed to integrate content and principles relevant to environmental education. For example, students can be engaged in constructing solar-powered devices, designing recycling centres, or creating media projects that focus on environmental awareness. 

LITERACY, MATHEMATICAL LITERACY, AND INQUIRY/RESEARCH SKILLS 

Literacy, mathematical literacy, and inquiry/research skills are critical to students' success in all subjects of the curriculum and in all areas of their lives. 

Many of the activities and tasks that students undertake in the technological education curriculum involve the literacy skills relating to oral, written, and visual communication. For example, students use language to describe their plans and the progress of their designs and projects in both informal and formal contexts, to produce work orders, and to report on the results of their projects in presentations and technical and other reports in oral, written, graphic, and multimedia forms. Technological education also requires the use and understanding of specialized terminology. In all technological education courses, students are required to use appropriate and correct terminology, and are encouraged to use language with care and precision in order to communicate effectively. 

The technological education program also builds on, reinforces, and enhances mathematical literacy. For example, clear, concise communication often involves the use of diagrams, tables, and graphs, and many components of the technological education curriculum emphasize students' ability to interpret and use symbols and charts. Students are also required to take accurate measurements, produce plans to specified dimensions, and use metric and imperial systems of measurement, as required in their particular area of study. 

Inquiry and research are at the heart of learning in all subject areas. In technological education courses, students are encouraged to develop their ability to analyse the context and background of challenges and to explore a variety of possible solutions to those challenges. As students advance through the grades, they acquire the skills to locate information relevant to solving problems and addressing challenges from a variety of sources, such as books, magazines, manuals, technical reports, dictionaries, client interviews, videos, and the Internet. As students in technological education courses conduct such research, teachers should guide them in recognizing that all sources of information have a particular point of view and that the recipient of the information has a responsibility to evaluate that information, determine its validity and relevance, and use it in appropriate ways. The ability to locate, question, and evaluate information allows a student to become an independent, lifelong learner. 

CAREER EDUCATION 

Ongoing discoveries and innovations coupled with rapidly evolving technologies have resulted in an exciting environment in which creativity and innovation thrive, bringing about new career opportunities. Today's employers seek candidates with strong technical skills, critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, and the ability to work cooperatively in a team, traits that are developed through participation in technological education. Technological education courses enable students to develop problem-solving skills, design skills, technical knowledge and skills, and the ability to conduct research, present results, and work on projects both independently and in a team environment. 

COOPERATIVE EDUCATION AND OTHER FORMS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING 

Cooperative education and other forms of experiential learning, such as job shadowing, field trips, and work experience, are central to technological education, enabling students to apply the skills they have developed in the classroom to real-life activities in the community and in the world of technological innovation. Cooperative education and other workplace experiences also help to broaden students' knowledge of employment opportunities in a wide range of fields, including industrial, motive power, construction, service, and agricultural trades; engineering; hospitality and tourism; and health care. In addition, students develop their understanding of workplace practices, certifications, and the nature of employer�employee relationships. Teachers of technological education can support their students' learning by maintaining links with community-based businesses to ensure that students have access to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills gained in school. 

Students who choose a technological education course as the related course for two cooperative education credits are able, through this packaged program, to meet the group 1, 2, and 3 compulsory credit requirements for the OSSD. 

Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure that students understand the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies and reporting procedures with respect to all forms of abuse and harassment. 

Policy/Program Memorandum No. 76A, "Workplace Safety and Insurance Coverage for Students in Work Education Programs" (September 2000), outlines procedures for ensuring the provision of Health and Safety Insurance Board coverage for students who are at least 14 years of age and are on placements of more than one day. (A one-day job-shadowing or job-twinning experience is treated as a field trip.) Teachers should also be aware of the minimum age requirements outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act for persons to be in or to be working in specific workplace settings. All cooperative education and other workplace experiences will be provided in accordance with the ministry's policy document Cooperative Education and Other Forms of Experiential Learning: Policies and Procedures for Ontario Secondary Schools, 2000. 

PLANNING PROGRAM PATHWAYS AND PROGRAMS LEADING TO A SPECIALIST HIGH SKILLS MAJOR 

Technological education courses are well suited for inclusion in some programs leading to a Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) or in programs designed to provide pathways to particular apprenticeship or workplace destinations. In some SHSM programs, technological education courses can be bundled with other courses to provide the academic knowledge and skills important to particular industry sectors and required for success in the workplace and postsecondary education, including apprenticeship. Technological education courses may also be combined with cooperative education credits to provide the workplace experience required for some SHSM programs and for various program pathways to apprenticeship and workplace destinations. SHSM programs would also include sector-specific learning opportunities offered by employers, skills-training centres, colleges, and community organizations.

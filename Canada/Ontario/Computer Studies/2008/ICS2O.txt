THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPUTER STUDIES IN THE CURRICULUM 

Computer studies is about how computers compute. It is not about learning how to use the computer, and it is much more than computer programming. Computer studies is the study of ways of representing objects and processes. It involves defining problems; analysing problems; designing solutions; and developing, testing, and maintaining programs. For the purposes of this document, the term computer studies refers to the study of computer science, meaning computer and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their applications, and their impact on society. The major focus of these courses is the development of programming skills, which are important for success in future postsecondary studies.

Computer studies is relevant for all students because it incorporates a broad range of transferable problem-solving skills and techniques, including logical thinking, creative design, synthesis, and evaluation. It also teaches generically useful skills in such areas as communication, time management, organization, and teamwork. Students live in a technologically rich world, and computer studies will provide them with the knowledge and skills to understand the underpinnings of current computer technology and prepare them for emerging technologies. A foundation in this discipline will introduce students to the excitement and opportunities afforded by this dynamic field and will begin to prepare them for a range of rewarding careers. 

The computer studies program will build a strong foundation for those who wish to move on to further study and training in specialized areas such as computer programming, database analysis, computer science, education, computer engineering, software engineering, information technology, and game development.

The Goals of the Computer Studies Program

The fundamental purpose of the computer studies program is to provide students with knowledge, skills, and attitudes that will enable them to achieve success in secondary school, the workplace, postsecondary education or training, and daily life. 

The goals of the computer studies curriculum are to enable students to: 
-	gain an understanding of computer studies concepts;
-	develop the skills, including critical thinking skills, and the knowledge of strategies required to do research, conduct inquiries, and communicate findings accurately, ethically, and effectively; 
-	apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes acquired through the study of computers to a variety of learning tasks and relate them to computer phenomena on the local, national, and global levels; 
-	develop lifelong learning habits that will help them adapt to computer advances in the changing workplace and world; 
-	make connections that will help them take advantage of potential postsecondary educational and work opportunities. 

FOUR CRITICAL AREAS OF LEARNING IN COMPUTER STUDIES

Effective learning in all aspects of computer studies depends on the  development of knowledge and skills in the following four areas: 
-	Software development (including project management and software engineering principles)
-	Algorithms and data structures
-	Program correctness and efficiency
-	Professional and ethical responsibility

The computer studies curriculum in Grades 10 to 12 offers a range of courses, all of which are structured to give students a solid foundation in these four areas.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN COMPUTER STUDIES PROGRAMS 

Students
Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning. Students who make the effort required to succeed in school and who are able to apply themselves will soon discover that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and will therefore be more motivated to work. There will be some students, however, who will find it more difficult to take responsibility for their learning because of special challenges they face. The attention, patience, and encouragement of teachers can be extremely important to the success of these students. However, taking responsibility for their own progress and learning is an important part of education for all students, regardless of their circumstances. 

Mastering the concepts and skills connected with computer studies requires work, study, and the development of cooperative skills. In addition, students who actively pursue opportunities outside the classroom will extend and enrich their understanding of computers and related topics and issues. Their understanding and skills will grow as they engage in recreational activities that involve computer use (e.g., computer clubs), reading related to computers (e.g., magazines, Internet sources), and learning about advances in computer studies (e.g., attending computer fairs). 

Parents 
Parents1 have an important role to play in supporting student learning. Studies show that students perform better in school if their parents are involved in their education. By becoming familiar with the curriculum, parents can determine what is being taught in the courses their daughters and sons are taking and what they are expected to learn. This awareness will enhance parents' ability to discuss their children's work with them, to communicate with teachers, and to ask relevant questions about their children's progress. Knowledge of the expectations in the various courses will also help parents to interpret teachers' comments on student progress and to work with teachers to improve their children's learning. 

Effective ways in which parents can support their children's learning include attending parent-teacher interviews, participating in parent workshops, becoming involved in school council activities (including becoming a school council member), and encouraging students to complete their assignments at home. In addition to supporting regular school activities, parents may wish to provide their daughters and sons with opportunities to question and reflect on current affairs, including developments in the field of emerging technologies.

Teachers 
Teachers and students have complementary responsibilities. Teachers develop appropriate instructional strategies to help students achieve the curriculum expectations, as well as appropriate methods for assessing and evaluating student learning. Teachers also support students in developing the reading, writing, oral communication, and numeracy skills needed for success in all their courses. Teachers bring enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing different student needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student. 

Using a variety of instructional, assessment, and evaluation strategies, teachers provide numerous opportunities for students to develop a range of skills and knowledge, including knowledge of computer studies concepts, structures, and processes, that will allow them to participate more effectively in their communities as responsible and active citizens.  

Principals 
The principal works in partnership with teachers and parents to ensure that each student has access to the best possible educational experience. To support student learning, principals ensure that the Ontario curriculum is being properly implemented in all classrooms using a variety of instructional approaches. They also ensure that appropriate resources are made available for teachers and students. To enhance teaching and learning in all subjects, including computer studies, principals promote learning teams and work with teachers to facilitate their participation in professional development activities. Principals are also responsible for ensuring that every student who has an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is receiving the modifications and/or accommodations described in his or her plan ' in other words, for ensuring that the IEP is properly developed, implemented, and monitored. 

THE PROGRAM IN COMPUTER STUDIES 

OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM 
The computer studies program comprises courses in Grades 10, 11, and 12. Three types of courses are offered in the program: university preparation, college preparation, and open courses. Students choose between course types on the basis of their interests, achievement, and postsecondary goals. The course types are defined as follows: 
-	University preparation courses are designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to meet the entrance requirements for university programs. 
-	College preparation courses are designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to meet the requirements for entrance to most college programs or for admission to apprenticeship or other training programs.
-	Open courses are designed to broaden students' knowledge and skills in subjects that reflect their interests and to prepare them for active and rewarding participation in society. They are not designed with the specific requirements of universities, colleges, or the workplace in mind.

The program in computer studies offers a variety of courses to help students develop a deeper understanding of the world of computer science and computer programming, and to help focus their interests in this area.  

The Grade 10 open course will appeal to any student interested in exploring how computers are used to solve problems. The course provides students with the opportunity to develop the logical thinking processes used in designing computer solutions to problems and to acquire basic computer programming skills that will enable them to create a working computer program.  

College preparation courses focus on the development of computer programming skills. These courses introduce students to the types of programs offered at community colleges - programs that focus on the practical skills businesses currently demand. Students are given opportunities to use problem-solving strategies and tools to address challenges such as creating custom programs, tailoring existing program packages, and using database management systems and scripting languages.

University preparation courses provide students with a foundation in the broad spectrum of computer science concepts and applications. In these courses, students explore the theoretical underpinnings of computer science; design software, working independently and as part of a team and using industry-standard programming tools and the software development life-cycle model; and investigate various computer science'related topics, such as cryptography and artificial intelligence.

The computer studies program is designed to enable students to select courses that relate to their interests and that will prepare them for further study or work in the field of their choosing. Computer studies courses are well suited for inclusion in programs that lead to a diploma with a Specialist High Skills Major designation. Whether students eventually work in the computer field or simply use computers, the computer studies program will provide them with a foundation for making informed decisions about their future plans.

CURRICULUM EXPECTATIONS 

The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and skills that students are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class work, on tests, and in various other activities on which their achievement is assessed and evaluated. 

Two sets of expectations are listed for each strand, or broad curriculum area, of each course. (The strands are numbered A, B, C, and so on.) 
-	The overall expectations describe in general terms the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate by the end of each course. 
-	The specific expectations describe the expected knowledge and skills in greater detail. The specific expectations are grouped under numbered subheadings, each of which indicates the strand and the overall expectation to which the subgrouping of specific expectations corresponds (e.g., "B2" indicates that the group relates to overall expectation 2 in strand B). The subheadings may serve as a guide for teachers as they plan learning activities for their students. 

Sample course page here from page 10.

Each computer studies course is organized into three or four strands, numbered A, B, C, and so on.

The overall expectations describe in general terms the knowledge and skills students are expected to demonstrate by the end of each course. Three or more overall expectations are provided for each strand in every course. The numbering of overall expectations indicates the strand to which they belong (e.g., B1 through B4 are the overall expectations for strand B).

A numbered subheading identifies each group of specific expectations and relates to one particular overall expectation (e.g., "B2. Designing Software Solutions" relates to overall expectation B2).

The specific expectations describe the expected knowledge and skills in greater detail. The expectation number identifies the strand to which the expectation belongs and the overall expectation to which it relates (e.g., B2.1, B2.2, B2.3, and so on, relate to the second overall expectation in strand B).

Examples are introduced by (e.g.) and appear in parentheses, set in italics, within specific expectations. The examples help to clarify the requirement specified in the expectation and to suggest its intended depth and level of complexity. The examples are illustrations only, not requirements.

The organization of expectations into strands and subgroupings is not meant to imply that the expectations in any one strand or group are achieved independently of the expectations in the other strands or groups. The strands and subgroupings are used merely to help teachers focus on particular aspects of knowledge and skills as they develop and present various lessons and learning activities for their students. The concepts, content, and skills identified in the different strands of each course should, wherever appropriate, be integrated in instruction throughout the course.

Many of the specific expectations are accompanied by examples, which are given in parentheses and italicized. These examples are meant to illustrate the kind of knowledge or skill, the specific area of learning, the depth of learning, and/or the level of complexity that the expectation entails. The examples are intended as a guide for teachers rather than as an exhaustive or mandatory list.

Teachers can choose to use the examples that are appropriate for their classrooms or they may develop their own approaches that reflect a similar level of complexity. Whatever the specific ways in which the requirements outlined in the expectations are implemented in the classroom, they must, wherever possible, be inclusive and reflect the diversity of the student population and the population of the province. 

STRANDS IN THE COMPUTER STUDIES CURRICULUM 

Each course in computer studies is organized into distinct but related strands. The strands are particular to each course. 

The Grade 10 course is organized in three strands: A. Understanding Computers; B. Introduction to Programming; and C. Computers and Society.

Each of the Grade 11 and 12 courses has four strands. In each course, the first strand is "A. Programming Concepts and Skills", and the second is "B. Software Development". The third strand (strand C) in each of the courses focuses on the programming environment, and the Grade 12 university preparation course features Designing Modular Pro-grams in this strand. The fourth strand (strand D) deals with the role of computers in society, and includes expectations regarding environmental concerns, the ethical use of computers, and career exploration. In this strand, the university preparation courses also explore new research in the field of information and computer science, and its implications for society.

ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATIONOF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT

BASIC CONSIDERATIONS 

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students' strengths and weaknesses in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students' needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices. 

Assessment is the process of gathering information from a variety of sources (including assignments, demonstrations, projects, performances, and tests) that accurately reflects how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a course. As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts towards improvement. Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality. 

Assessment and evaluation will be based on the provincial curriculum expectations and the achievement levels outlined in this document. 

In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evaluation strategies that: 
-	address both what students learn and how well they learn; 
-	are based both on the categories of knowledge and skills and on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart on pages 16-17; 
-	are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning; 
-	are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students; 
-	are fair to all students; 
-	accommodate the needs of students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan; 
-	accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction (English or French);
-	ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement; 
-	promote students' ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals; 
-	include the use of samples of students' work that provide evidence of their achievement; 
-	are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the course or the school term and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.
 
Evaluation of Achievement of Overall Expectations
All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students- achievement of the overall expectations. A student's achievement of the overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of his or her achievement of related specific expectations. The overall expectations are broad in nature, and the specific expectations define the particular content or scope of the knowledge and skills referred to in the overall expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of the overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment (e.g., through direct observation) but not necessarily evaluated. 

Levels of Achievement
The characteristics given in the achievement chart (pages 16-17) for level 3 represent the "provincial standard" for achievement of the expectations in a course. A complete picture of overall achievement at level 3 in a course in computer studies can be constructed by reading from top to bottom in the shaded column of the achievement chart, headed "70-79% (Level 3)". Parents of students achieving at level 3 can be confident that their children will be prepared for work in subsequent courses. 

Level 1 identifies achievement that falls much below the provincial standard, while still reflecting a passing grade. Level 2 identifies achievement that approaches the standard. Level 4 identifies achievement that surpasses the standard. It should be noted that achievement at level 4 does not mean that the student has achieved expectations beyond those specified for a particular course. It indicates that the student has achieved all or almost all of the expectations for that course, and that he or she demonstrates the ability to use the specified knowledge and skills in more sophisticated ways than a student achieving at level 3.

THE ACHIEVEMENT CHART FOR COMPUTER STUDIES 

The achievement chart that follows identifies four categories of knowledge and skills in computer studies. The achievement chart is a standard province-wide guide to be used by teachers. It enables teachers to make judgements about student work that are based on clear performance standards and on a body of evidence collected over time. 

The purpose of the achievement chart is to: 
-	provide a common framework that encompasses all curriculum expectations for all courses outlined in this document; 
-	guide the development of quality assessment tasks and tools (including rubrics); 
-	help teachers to plan instruction for learning; 
-	assist teachers in providing meaningful feedback to students; 
-	provide various categories and criteria with which to assess and evaluate students' learning. 

Categories of Knowledge and Skills 
The categories, defined by clear criteria, represent four broad areas of knowledge and skills within which the subject expectations for any given course are organized. The four categories should be considered as interrelated, reflecting the wholeness and interconnectedness of learning. 

The categories of knowledge and skills are described as follows: 

Knowledge and Understanding. Subject-specific content acquired in each course (knowledge), and the comprehension of its meaning and significance (understanding).

Thinking. The use of critical and creative thinking skills and/or processes, as follows:
-	planning skills (e.g., focusing research, gathering information, selecting strategies, organizing a project) 
-	processing skills (e.g., analysing, interpreting, assessing, reasoning, generating ideas, evaluating, synthesizing, seeking a variety of perspectives) 
-	critical/creative thinking processes (e.g., problem solving, decision making, research) 

Communication. The conveying of meaning through various forms.

Application. The use of knowledge and skills to make connections within and between various contexts.

Teachers will ensure that student work is assessed and/or evaluated in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories, and that achievement of particular expectations is considered within the appropriate categories. 

Criteria 
Within each category in the achievement chart, criteria are provided that are subsets of the knowledge and skills that define each category. For example, in Knowledge and Understanding, the criteria are "knowledge of content (e.g., facts, technical terminology, definitions, procedures, standards)" and "understanding of content (e.g., concepts, principles, methodologies, use of tools)". The criteria identify the aspects of student performance that are assessed and/or evaluated, and serve as guides to what to look for. 

Descriptors 
A "descriptor" indicates the characteristic of the student's performance, with respect to a particular criterion, on which assessment or evaluation is focused. In the achievement chart, effectiveness is the descriptor used for each criterion in the Thinking, Communication, and Application categories. What constitutes effectiveness in any given performance task will vary with the particular criterion being considered. Assessment of effectiveness may therefore focus on a quality such as appropriateness, clarity, accuracy, precision, logic, relevance, significance, fluency, flexibility, depth, or breadth, as appropriate for the particular criterion. For example, in the Thinking category, assessment of effectiveness might focus on the degree of relevance or depth apparent in an analysis; in the Communication category, on clarity of expression or logical organization of information and ideas; or in the Application category, on appropriateness or breadth in the making of connections. Similarly, in the Knowledge and Understanding category, assessment of knowledge might focus on accuracy, and assessment of understanding might focus on the depth of an explanation. Descriptors help teachers to focus their assessment and evaluation on specific knowledge and skills for each category and criterion, and help students to better understand exactly what is being assessed and evaluated. 

Qualifiers 
A specific "qualifier" is used to define each of the four levels of achievement - that is, limited for level 1, some for level 2, considerable for level 3, and a high degree or thorough for level 4. A qualifier is used along with a descriptor to produce a description of performance at a particular level. For example, the description of a student's performance at level 3 with respect to the first criterion in the Thinking category would be: "the student uses planning skills with considerable effectiveness". 

The descriptions of the levels of achievement given in the chart should be used to identify the level at which the student has achieved the expectations. In all of their courses, students should be given numerous and varied opportunities to demonstrate the full extent of their achievement of the curriculum expectations across all four categories of knowledge and skills.

Note: A student whose achievement is below 50% at the end of a course will not obtain a credit for the course.

EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT 
Student achievement must be communicated formally to students and parents by means of the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9-12. The report card provides a record of the student-s achievement of the curriculum expectations in every course, at particular points in the school year or semester, in the form of a percentage grade. The percentage grade represents the quality of the student's overall achievement of the expectations for the course and reflects the corresponding level of achievement as described in the achievement chart for the discipline. 

A final grade is recorded for every course, and a credit is granted and recorded for every course in which the student's grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for each course in Grades 9 to 12 will be determined as follows: 
-	Seventy per cent of the grade will be based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade should reflect the student's most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement. 
-	Thirty per cent of the grade will be based on a final evaluation in the form of an examination, performance, essay, and/or other method of evaluation suitable to the course content and administered towards the end of the course. 

REPORTING ON DEMONSTRATED LEARNING SKILLS 

The report card provides a record of the learning skills demonstrated by the student in every course, in the following five categories: Works Independently, Teamwork, Organization, Work Habits, and Initiative. The learning skills are evaluated using a four-point scale (E-Excellent, G-Good, S-Satisfactory, N-Needs Improvement). The separate evaluation and reporting of the learning skills in these five areas reflect their critical role in students' achievement of the curriculum expectations. To the extent possible, the evaluation of learning skills, apart from any that may be included as part of a curriculum expectation in a course, should not be considered in the determination of percentage grades. 

SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR PROGRAM PLANNING

Teachers who are planning a program in computer studies must take into account considerations in a number of important areas, including those discussed below. 

Instructional Approaches 
Students learn best when they are engaged in learning in a variety of ways. Computer studies courses lend themselves to a wide range of approaches in that they require students to discuss issues, solve problems, plan solutions, participate in the development of solutions, conduct research, think critically, and work cooperatively. When students are engaged in active and experiential learning, they tend to retain knowledge for longer periods and to develop, acquire, and integrate key skills more completely. 

Teachers need to model the skills they expect students to learn. For example, teachers should model ethical behaviour in the acquisition and use of software. They should model good program design and good coding practices in the examples and assignments they provide to students. However, in the end, students learn these skills through practice, so sufficient time to solve problems and code solutions must be provided. 

Students in a computer studies class typically demonstrate diversity in the ways they learn best. It is important, therefore, that students have opportunities to learn in a variety of ways - individually, cooperatively, independently, with teacher direction, through hands-on experience, and through examples followed by practice. In computer studies, students are required to learn concepts, skills, procedures, and processes. They develop competence in these various areas with the aid of instructional and learning strategies that are suited to the particular type of learning. The approaches and strategies used in the classroom to help students meet the expectations of this curriculum should vary according to both the type of learning and the individual needs of the students.

Some of the teaching and learning strategies that are suitable to material taught in computer studies employ scaffolding. Scaffolding is an instructional approach that involves breaking down tasks so that students can concentrate on specific, manageable objectives and gradually build understanding and skill, with the aid of modelling by the teacher and ample opportunity for practice. Scaffolding provides students with a supportive structure within which to learn.

Many of the concepts taught in computer studies involve abstract thinking, which can be challenging for many students. Role playing is one approach that can help students internalize new concepts.

Learning processes that involve students in physical activity can also lead to better understanding and longer retention of concepts. The use of kinesthetic learning can be an effective way to adapt computer studies to the varied learning styles that students may demonstrate. For example, the binary numbering system could be taught by means of a game called "binary chairs", wherein eight students represent a byte of data by sitting on or standing in front of eight chairs, depending on whether they represent binary 0 (sitting) or binary 1 (standing).

Working collaboratively can enhance student learning and foster positive attitudes. An example of a collaborative approach is "pair programming", which involves two students working at a single keyboard, one as a "driver" and the other as an "observer" or "navigator". Each student has a specific role, and both students are actively involved in the task. The students periodically switch roles during the project.  

The computer programming language used and the order in which concepts are taught is left to the teacher's professional judgement. Some teachers may decide to use an "objects-first" approach, while others may prefer to use structural program techniques to teach the same concepts.

Students' attitudes towards computer studies can have a significant effect on their achievement of expectations. Teaching methods and learning activities that encourage students to recognize the value and relevance of what they are learning will go a long way towards motivating them to work and learn effectively.

The Importance of Current Events in Computer Studies 
The study of current events and emerging technologies related to computer studies enhances both the relevance and the immediacy of the curriculum. Discussing current events and new technologies and including these topics in daily lessons stimulates student interest and curiosity and also helps students connect what they are learning in class with real-world events or situations. The study of current events needs to be thought of not as a separate topic removed from the program but as an effective instructional strategy for implementing many of the expectations found in the curriculum. 

The Role of ICT in Computer Studies 
Information and communications technologies (ICT) provide a range of tools that can significantly extend and enrich teachers' instructional strategies and support student learning. ICT tools include multimedia resources, databases, Internet websites, digital cameras, and word-processing programs. Tools such as these can help students to collect, organize, and sort the data they gather and to write, edit, and present reports on their findings. Information and communications technologies can also be used to connect students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into the local classroom. 

Whenever appropriate, therefore, students should be encouraged to use ICT to support and communicate their learning. For example, students working individually or in groups can use computer technology and/or Internet websites to gain access to a wide range of programming resources and aids. Students can also use digital cameras and projectors to design and present the results of their research to their classmates. 

Although the Internet is a powerful learning tool, there are potential risks attached to its use. All students must be made aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible use, as well as of the potential for abuse of this technology, particularly when it is used to bully or promote hatred. 

Teachers will find the various ICT tools useful in their teaching practice, both for whole-class instruction and for the design of curriculum units that contain varied approaches to learning to meet diverse student needs.

PLANNING COMPUTER STUDIES PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS

Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs. They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with special education resource teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal. Special Education Transformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs With the Recommendations of the Working Table on Special Education, 2006 endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for students with special education needs in all disciplines. Those beliefs are as follows: 
-	All students can succeed. 
-	Universal design3 and differentiated instruction4 are effective and interconnected means of meeting the learning or productivity needs of any group of students. 
-	Successful instructional practices are founded on evidence-based research, tempered by experience. 
-	Classroom teachers are key educators for a student's literacy and numeracy development. 
-	Each student has his or her own unique patterns of learning. 
-	Classroom teachers need the support of the larger community to create a learning environment that supports students with special education needs. 
-	Fairness is not sameness. 

3. The goal of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is to create a learning environment that is open and accessible to all students, regardless of age, skills, or situation. Instruction based on principles of universal design is flexible and supportive, can be adjusted to meet different student needs, and enables all students to access the curriculum as fully as possible.
 
4. Differentiated instruction is effective instruction that shapes each student's learning experience in response to his or her particular learning preferences, interests, and readiness to learn.

In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of strengths and needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest possible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs that accommodate a diversity of learning needs. 

In planning computer studies courses for students with special education needs, teachers should begin by examining the current achievement level of the individual student, 
the strengths and learning needs of the student, and the knowledge and skills that all 
students are expected to demonstrate at the end of the course, in order to determine which of the following options is appropriate for the student: 
-	no accommodations5 or modified expectations; or 
-	accommodations only; or 
-	modified expectations, with the possibility of accommodations; or 
-	alternative expectations, which are not derived from the curriculum expectations for a course and which constitute alternative programs and/or courses. 

5. "Accommodations" refers to individualized teaching and assessment strategies, human supports, and/or individualized equipment.

If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the relevant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative programs and/or courses,6 can be found in The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A Resource Guide, 2004 (referred to hereafter as the IEP Resource Guide, 2004). For a detailed discussion of the ministry's requirements for IEPs, see Individual Education Plans: Standards for Development, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000 (referred to hereafter as IEP Standards, 2000). (Both documents are available at www.edu.gov.on.ca.) 

6. Alternative programs are identified on the IEP form by the term "alternative (ALT)".

Students Requiring Accommodations Only 
Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student's learning must be identified in his or her IEP (see IEP Standards, 2000, page 11). A student's IEP is likely to reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. 

Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the diverse needs of learners. 

There are three types of accommodations: 
-	Instructional accommodations are changes in teaching strategies, including styles of presentation, methods of organization, or use of technology and multimedia. 
-	Environmental accommodations are changes that the student may require in the classroom and/or school environment, such as preferential seating or special lighting. 
-	Assessment accommodations are changes in assessment procedures that enable the student to demonstrate his or her learning, such as allowing additional time to complete tests or assignments or permitting oral responses to test questions (see page 29 of the IEP Resource Guide, 2004, for more examples). 

If a student requires "accommodations only" in computer studies courses, assessment and evaluation of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expectations and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student's Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of accommodations will be included. 

Students Requiring Modified Expectations 
Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations. Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achievements and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations. 

It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student's IEP, the extent to which expectations have been modified. As noted in Section 7.12 of the ministry's policy document Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999, the principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and the student. 

When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course, the modified expectations should identify how the required knowledge and skills differ from those identified in the course expectations. When modifications are so extensive that achievement of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely to result in a credit, the expectations should specify the precise requirements or tasks on which the student's performance will be evaluated and which will be used to generate the course mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. 

Modified expectations indicate the knowledge and/or skills the student is expected to demonstrate and have assessed in each reporting period (see IEP Standards, 2000, pages 10 and 11). The student's learning expectations must be reviewed in relation to the student's progress at least once every reporting period, and must be updated as necessary (see IEP Standards, 2000, page 11). 

If a student requires modified expectations in computer studies courses, assessment and evaluation of his or her achievement will be based on the learning expectations identified in the IEP and on the achievement levels outlined in this document. If some of the student's learning expectations for a course are modified but the student is working towards a credit for the course, it is sufficient simply to check the IEP box on the Provincial Report Card. If, however, the student's learning expectations are modified to such an extent that the principal deems that a credit will not be granted for the course, the IEP box must be checked and the appropriate statement from the Guide to the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9-12, 1999 (page 8) must be inserted. The teacher's comments should include relevant information on the student's demonstrated learning of the modified expectations, as well as next steps for the student's learning in the course. 

PROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS 

Ontario schools have some of the most multilingual student populations in the world. The first language of approximately 20 per cent of the students in Ontario's English language schools is a language other than English. Ontario's linguistic heritage includes several Aboriginal languages and many African, Asian, and European languages. It also includes some varieties of English - also referred to as dialects - that differ significantly from the English required for success in Ontario schools. Many English language learners were born in Canada and have been raised in families and communities in which languages other than English, or varieties of English that differ from the language used in the classroom, are spoken. Other English language learners arrive in Ontario as newcomers from other countries; they may have experience of highly sophisticated educational systems, or they may have come from regions where access to formal schooling was limited. 

When they start school in Ontario, many of these students are entering a new linguistic and cultural environment. All teachers share in the responsibility for these students' English language development. 

English language learners (students who are learning English as a second or additional language in English language schools) bring a rich diversity of background knowledge and experience to the classroom. These students' linguistic and cultural backgrounds not only support their learning in their new environment but also become a cultural asset in the classroom community. Teachers will find positive ways to incorporate this diversity into their instructional programs and into the classroom environment. 

Most English language learners in Ontario schools have an age-appropriate proficiency in their first language. Although they need frequent opportunities to use English at school, there are important educational and social benefits associated with continued development of their first language while they are learning English. Teachers need to encourage parents to continue to use their own language at home in rich and varied ways as a foundation for language and literacy development in English. It is also important for teachers to find opportunities to bring students' languages into the classroom, using parents and community members as a resource. 

During their first few years in Ontario schools, English language learners may receive support through one of two distinct programs from teachers who specialize in meeting their language-learning needs: 

English as a Second Language (ESL) programs are for students born in Canada or newcomers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools. 

English Literacy Development (ELD) programs are primarily for newcomers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools, and who arrive with significant gaps in their education. These students generally come from countries where access to education is limited or where there are limited opportunities to develop language and literacy skills in any language. Some Aboriginal students from remote communities in Ontario may also have had limited opportunities for formal schooling, and they also may benefit from ELD instruction. 

In planning programs for students with linguistic backgrounds other than English, teachers need to recognize the importance of the orientation process, understanding that every learner needs to adjust to the new social environment and language in a unique way and at an individual pace. For example, students who are in an early stage of English-language acquisition may go through a "silent period" during which they closely observe the interactions and physical surroundings of their new learning environment. They may use body language rather than speech or they may use their first language until they have gained enough proficiency in English to feel confident of their interpretations and responses. Students thrive in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment that nurtures their self-confidence while they are receiving focused literacy instruction. When they are ready to participate in paired, small-group, or whole-class activities, some students will begin by using a single word or phrase to communicate a thought, while others will speak quite fluently. 

With exposure to the English language in a supportive learning environment, most young children will develop oral fluency quite quickly, making connections between concepts and skills acquired in their first language and similar concepts and skills presented in English. However, oral fluency is not a good indicator of a student's knowledge of vocabulary or sentence structure, reading comprehension, or other aspects of language proficiency that play an important role in literacy development and academic success. Research has shown that it takes five to seven years for most English language learners to catch up to their English-speaking peers in their ability to use English for academic purposes. Moreover, the older the children are when they arrive, the greater the amount of language knowledge and skills that they have to catch up on, and the more direct support they require from their teachers. 

Responsibility for students' English-language development is shared by the classroom teacher, the ESL/ELD teacher (where available), and other school staff. Volunteers and peers may also be helpful in supporting English language learners in the language classroom. Teachers must adapt the instructional program in order to facilitate the success of these students in their classrooms. Appropriate adaptations include: 
-	modification of some or all of the subject expectations so that they are challenging but attainable for the learner at his or her present level of English proficiency, given the necessary support from the teacher; 
-	use of a variety of instructional strategies (e.g., extensive use of visual cues, graphic organizers, and scaffolding; previewing of textbooks; pre-teaching of key vocabulary; peer tutoring; strategic use of students' first languages); 
-	use of a variety of learning resources (e.g., visual material, simplified text, bilingual dictionaries, and materials that reflect cultural diversity); 
-	use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting of extra time; use of oral interviews, demonstrations or visual representations, or tasks requiring completion of graphic organizers or cloze sentences instead of essay questions and other assessment tasks that depend heavily on proficiency in English). 

When learning expectations in any course are modified for an English language learner (whether the student is enrolled in an ESL or ELD course or not), this information must be clearly indicated on the student-s report card. 

Although the degree of program adaptation required will decrease over time, students who are no longer receiving ESL or ELD support may still need some program adaptations to be successful. 

For further information on supporting English language learners, refer to The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 9-12: English as a Second Language and English Literacy Development, 2007; English Language Learners - ESL and ELD Programs and Services: Policies and Procedures for Ontario Elementary and Secondary Schools, Kindergarten to Grade 12, 2007; and the resource guide Many Roots, Many Voices: Supporting English Language Learners in Every Classroom, 2005.

ANTIDISCRIMINATION EDUCATION IN COMPUTER STUDIES

The implementation of antidiscrimination principles in education influences all aspects of school life. It promotes a school climate that encourages all students to work to attain high standards, affirms the worth of all students, and helps students strengthen their sense of identity and develop a positive self-image. It encourages staff and students alike to value and show respect for diversity in the school and the wider society. It requires schools to adopt measures to provide a safe environment for learning, free from harassment, violence, and expressions of hate. 

Antidiscrimination education encourages students to think critically about themselves and others in the world around them in order to promote fairness, healthy relationships, and active, responsible citizenship. 

Schools have the responsibility to ensure that school-community interaction reflects the diversity in the local community and wider society. Consideration should be given to a variety of strategies for communicating and working with parents and community members from diverse groups, in order to ensure their participation in such school activities as plays, concerts, and teacher interviews. Families new to Canada, who may be unfamiliar with the Ontario school system, or parents of Aboriginal students may need special outreach and encouragement in order to feel comfortable in their interactions with the school. 

When planning instructional activities for computer studies, teachers should base their decisions on the needs of students, taking into consideration the diversity of their abilities, backgrounds, interests, and learning styles. Teaching strategies, assessment and evaluation materials, and the classroom environment should be designed to value the experiences and contributions of all people. 

Participation rates in computer studies tend to be higher for male students than for female students. To encourage greater participation among female students, it may be helpful to offer more projects and activities that have socially meaningful applications. For example, projects to develop assistive devices, as opposed to the more traditional activity of programming robotic arms, have proved successful in engaging the interest of female students. Similarly, projects involving graphical programming to develop animated stories, as opposed to abstract gaming activities, may hold more appeal for young women. Providing outreach programs and establishing study groups for young women may help them develop greater self-confidence in computer studies. Technology fairs and showcase events can introduce all students to a wide range of programming and computer-related activities, such as animation and graphical programming, and may encourage an interest in programming. Offering choices from a range of instructional activities or allowing students to select their own projects can help motivate all students in a classroom by acknowledging the differences in their experiences, attitudes, and interests.

It is important to have open and frank discussions about the kind of workplace environment students are likely to encounter in the field of computer science. Inviting female and visible minority role models who have had successful careers in computer studies as guest speakers and recruiting female and visible minority senior students as mentors can enhance the interest and motivation of students for whom computer studies may be a non-traditional field. Also, exploring strategies to enable students with different learning and social styles to work effectively together can encourage participation by students whose presence will lead to a more inclusive working environment.

ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND COMPUTER STUDIES
Environmental education is education about the environment, for the environment, and in the environment that promotes an understanding of, rich and active experience in, and an appreciation for the dynamic interactions of:
-	The Earth's physical and biological systems
-	The dependency of our social and economic systems on these natural systems
-	The scientific and human dimensions of environmental issues
-	The positive and negative consequences, both intended and unintended, of the interactions between human-created and natural systems.

Shaping Our Schools, Shaping Our Future: 
Environmental Education in Ontario Schools (June 2007), p. 6

As noted in Shaping Our Schools, Shaping Our Future, environmental education "is the responsibility of the entire education community. It is a content area and can be taught. It is an approach to critical thinking, citizenship, and personal responsibility, and can be modelled. It is a context that can enrich and enliven education in all subject areas and offer students the opportunity to develop a deeper connection with themselves, their role in society, and their interdependence on one another and the Earth's natural systems" (p. 10).

There are many opportunities to integrate environmental education into the teaching of computer studies. In each of the computer studies courses, the expectations relating to environmental stewardship and sustainability allow students to focus on learning related to critical thinking, citizenship, and personal responsibility. Students analyse the impact of computer use on the environment. Questions about the safe handling and disposal of materials and substances used in computer studies provide students with opportunities to explore how simple human interactions with the environment can have significant consequences. Students will be expected to actively engage in developing and implementing strategies to reduce, reuse, and recycle computers, their products, and associated technologies. As well, they will research government agencies and community partners who have developed relevant opportunities to support these activities. By identifying and implementing measures to reduce the negative effects of computers on the environment, students will contribute to responsible environmental stewardship.

Programming projects can be used to support these expectations. For example, students might program a survey to assess people's knowledge of environmentally responsible strategies related to the use of computers. The program could be designed to calculate the respondent's "environmental awareness" grade and suggest additional strategies, or it could be designed to provide feedback for each survey question. Students could also design surveys to assess the use of environmentally responsible practices in the classroom.

Environmental education can also be integrated into the design of other programming projects, such as simulations that model healthy ecosystems (showing the balance between plants and animals in an enclosed system); or the consequences of an environmental catastrophe such as an oil spill on a coastline (including the speed and depth of the oil spread and the impact of the oil on the area affected); or the social costs and benefits of designing energy-efficient buildings. The dynamic relationships resulting from human interaction with the environment provide a rich context for developing authentic learning activities within computer studies courses.

LITERACY, MATHEMATICAL LITERACY, AND INQUIRY/RESEARCH SKILLS 

Literacy, mathematical literacy, and inquiry/research skills are critical to students' success in all subjects of the curriculum and in all areas of their lives.

Many of the activities and tasks that students undertake in the computer studies curriculum involve literacy skills relating to oral, written, and visual communication. For example, students use language to describe their observations, to describe their critical analyses in both informal and formal contexts, and to present their findings in presentations and reports in oral, written, graphic, and multimedia forms. Computer studies also requires the use and understanding of specialized terminology. In all computer studies courses, students are expected to use appropriate and correct terminology, and are encouraged to use language with care and precision in order to communicate effectively.

The computer studies program also builds on, reinforces, and enhances mathematical literacy. For example, clear, concise communication often involves the use of diagrams, tables, and graphs, and many components of the computer studies curriculum emphasize students' ability to interpret and use symbols and charts. 

Inquiry is at the heart of learning in all subject areas. In computer studies courses, students are encouraged to develop their ability to ask questions and to explore a variety of possible answers to those questions. As they advance through the grades, they acquire the skills to locate relevant information from a variety of sources, such as books, periodicals, dictionaries, encyclopedias, interviews, videos, and the Internet. The questioning they practised in the early grades becomes more sophisticated as they learn that all sources of information have a particular point of view and that the recipient of the information has a responsibility to evaluate it, determine its validity and relevance, and use it in appropriate ways. The ability to locate, question, and evaluate information allows a student to become an independent, lifelong learner. 

THE ONTARIO SKILLS PASSPORT AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS 

Teachers planning programs in computer studies need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP). The OSP is a bilingual web-based resource that enhances the relevance of classroom learning for students and strengthens school-work connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text, Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service. The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students' demonstration of these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can use the OSP to assess, practise, and build their Essential Skills and work habits and transfer them to a job or further education or training. 

The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their jobs and adapt to workplace change. For further information on the OSP and the Essential Skills, visit http://skills.edu.gov.on.ca. 

CAREER EDUCATION 

Ongoing discoveries and innovations coupled with rapidly evolving technologies have resulted in an exciting environment in which creativity and innovation thrive, bringing about new career opportunities. Today's employers seek candidates with strong technical skills, critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, and the ability to work cooperatively in a team, traits that are developed through participation in computer studies courses.  Computer studies courses enable students to develop, for example, problem-solving skills, design skills, technical knowledge and skills, and the ability to conduct research, present results, and work on projects both independently and in a team environment. 

COOPERATIVE EDUCATION AND OTHER FORMS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING 

Cooperative education and other forms of experiential learning, such as job shadowing, field trips, and work experience, enable students to apply the skills they have developed in the classroom to real-life activities in the community and in the world of business and public service. Cooperative education and other workplace experiences also help to broaden students' knowledge of employment opportunities in a wide range of fields, including computer programming, database analysis, computer science, education, computer engineering, software engineering, information technology, and game development. In addition, students develop their understanding of workplace practices, certifications, and the nature of employer/employee relationships. Teachers of computer studies can support their students' learning by maintaining links with community-based businesses to ensure that students have access to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills gained in school. 

Students who choose a computer studies course as the related course for two cooperative education credits are able, through this packaged program, to meet the OSSD compulsory credit requirements for groups 1, 2, and 3.

Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure that students understand the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies and reporting procedures with respect to all forms of abuse and harassment. 

Policy/Program Memorandum No. 76A, "Workplace Safety and Insurance Coverage for Students in Work Education Programs" (September 2000), outlines procedures for ensuring the provision of Health and Safety Insurance Board coverage for students who are at least 14 years of age and are on placements of more than one day. (A one-day job-shadowing or job-twinning experience is treated as a field trip.) Teachers should also be aware of the minimum age requirements outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act for persons to be in or to be working in specific workplace settings. All cooperative education and other workplace experiences will be provided in accordance with the ministry's policy document Cooperative Education and Other Forms of Experiential Learning: Policies and Procedures for Ontario Secondary Schools, 2000. 

PLANNING PROGRAM PATHWAYS AND PROGRAMS LEADING TO A SPECIALIST HIGH SKILLS MAJOR 

Computer studies courses are well suited for inclusion in some programs leading to a Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) or in programs designed to provide pathways to particular apprenticeship or workplace destinations. In some SHSM programs, computer studies courses can be bundled with other courses to provide the academic knowledge and skills important to particular industry sectors and required for success in the workplace and postsecondary education, including apprenticeship. Computer studies courses may also be combined with cooperative education credits to provide the workplace experience required for SHSM programs and for various program pathways to apprenticeship and workplace destinations. (SHSM programs would also include sector-specific learning opportunities offered by employers, skills-training centres, colleges, and community organizations.) 

HEALTH AND SAFETY IN COMPUTER STUDIES 

The major health and safety concerns associated with computer use are musculoskeletal injuries (including repetitive strain injuries) and eye strain. Teachers should not only ensure that workstations are ergonomically arranged but also encourage students to maintain good posture and to take regular breaks to stand and stretch. It is also important to inform students of the mental and emotional health risks associated with social isolation - a familiar condition among heavy computer users. 

Various kinds of health and safety issues can arise when learning involves field trips. Out-of-school field trips can provide an exciting and authentic dimension to students' learning experiences. They also take the teacher and students out of the predictable classroom environment and into unfamiliar settings. Teachers must preview and plan these activities carefully to protect students' health and safety.
